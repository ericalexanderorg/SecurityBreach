Our first line of defense was to block the offending addresses, but ultimately we needed to enable captcha to stop the attack. After the attack was over, we diagnosed that 124 accounts had unauthorized access from the attack. It seemed like the attack focused on first validating which accounts were vulnerable, perhaps with a plan to later exploit these vulnerable accounts. Thankfully we were able to detect and stop the attack very quickly, and also ensure that any intruders were prevented further access. Protecting yourself against attacks like this is important. We've since beefed up our CAPTCHA protection across all applications and all clients, which has been effective at stopping the attack. CAPTCHA isn't perfect, and some times it's annoying, but it has provided effective protection against this wave of attack.
