Embedded system software provider Wind River Systems has started informing employees of a data breach that resulted in their personal information being stolen by a third party. Its product portfolio includes the Wind River Linux operating system and the VxWorks real-time operating system. A copy of the data breach notification that the company has filed with California's Attorney General reveals that the newly disclosed security incident took place on or around September 29, 2020. Wind River says that the type of personal information compromised might vary, and would include the information stored in the company's personnel records. Thus, compromised employee data could include birth dates, driver's license numbers, national identification numbers, social security numbers, social insurance numbers, passport or visa numbers, health details, and/or financial account information. Wind River hasn't provided information on the number of affected employees, or how the attackers were able to compromise its systems. SecurityWeek has reached out to Wind River for additional information on the security incident and will update this article as soon as a reply arrives.
