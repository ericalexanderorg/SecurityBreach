A Vermont-based hospital network is now saying a cyberattack that crippled its computer systems in October was ransomware. While the Burlington-based University of Vermont Health Network, which serves hospitals in Vermont and upstate New York, had said its systems were attacked on Oct. 28, officials had not confirmed the attack that disabled the system's 600 applications was ransomware. On Tuesday, hospital officials said its information technology workers found a file directing them to contact the attackers if they wanted their systems restored, but it did not contain a request for money. The hospital contacted the FBI, which is continuing to investigate. Since the attack, the hospital has been rebuilding all 1,300 of its servers and restoring the backups. The hospital said that before the attack they had strong security measures in place, but the attackers still found a way in. The same day as the attack on UVM Health Network, the FBI and two federal agencies warned cybercriminals were ramping up efforts to steal data and disrupt services across the health care sector.
