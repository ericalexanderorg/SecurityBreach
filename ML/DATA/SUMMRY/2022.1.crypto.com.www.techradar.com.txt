One of the world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges has been hit by a major data breach. Talking to Bloomberg, Crypto.com, CEO Kris Marszalek confirmed that the recent data breach resulted in funds being taken from roughly 400 accounts. The amount of funds linked to cryptocurrency-related crime rose by almost 80% last year, recent figures from the blockchain data platform Chainalysis show. Illicit addresses received $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency over the course of 2021, up from $7.8 billion the year before, the report says. Total transaction volume across all cryptocurrencies rose by 567% from 2020 highs, totaling $15.8 trillion. Most crypto frauds these days revolve around so-called "Rugpulls". People fall for the age-old "I've sent Elon Musk 0.1 BTC and he'll return 1.0 BTC tomorrow" fraud so often that a Twitter bot is able to track known "Fake Elon Musk" addresses, reporting when people send their hard-earned crypto assets.
