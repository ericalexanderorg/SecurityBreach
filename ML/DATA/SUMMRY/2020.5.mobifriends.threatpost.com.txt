The credentials of 3.5 million users of MobiFriends, a popular dating app, have surfaced on a prominent deep web hacking forum, according to researchers. The compromised credentials were originally posted for sale on an underground forum on Jan. 12 by a threat actor named "DonJuji," according to a RBS post on Thursday. The credentials were later shared for free however on April 12 by a different threat actor on the same forum, researchers said. "Furthermore, the exposure of user credentials allows threat actors to check them against other websites in a brute-force fashion. If the credentials have been re-used, the threat actors may be able to gain access to more valuable accounts i.e. banking accounts, social media accounts, etc." Neither RBS nor Threatpost has heard back from MobiFriends regarding the compromised data despite multiple attempts at contact. Leaked credentials continue to be a top threat for companies. In January, a hacker published a list of credentials for more than 515,000 servers, home routers and other Internet of Things devices online on a popular hacking forum in what was touted as the biggest leak of Telnet passwords to date.
