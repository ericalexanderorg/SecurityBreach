As a result, we recommended that all users change their passwords as a precaution and security best practice. We recently became aware of claims stating that some Poshmark passwords were compromised, and we believe that may have resulted from security incidents affecting other sites and the reuse of passwords. We take your security extremely seriously and are committed to continuing to strengthen our platform. Regardless, we recommend that you change your password as a precaution and security best practice. Certain internal account information such as email address, user ID, size preferences, and one-way encrypted passwords salted uniquely per user, as well as social media profile information collected when users connect social media accounts to Poshmark. We take the trust you have placed in us extremely seriously, and since learning of this incident, we've expanded our security measures even further. We've conducted an internal investigation, retained a leading security forensics firm, and have implemented enhanced security measures across all systems to help prevent this type of incident from happening in the future.
