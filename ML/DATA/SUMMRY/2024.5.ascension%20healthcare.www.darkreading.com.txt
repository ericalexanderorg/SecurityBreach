Healthcare provider Ascension, which operates 140 hospitals across 19 states, fell victim to a cyberattack that took down multiple essential systems including electronic health records, the MyChart platform for patient communication, and certain medication and test-ordering systems. Ascension's cyberattack comes on the heels of a February ransomware attack on United Healthcare's Change Healthcare subsidiary, which caused chaos for days with outages across multiple hospitals and facilities. Mark Manglicmot, senior vice president of security services for Arctic Wolf, says Ascension's cyber incident is a grim reminder that healthcare organizations are an "Incredibly hot" target, and attacks on their infrastructure have consequences far beyond a ransom demand. "Last year, the median ransomware demand in the healthcare industry was $450,000; although this is a steep ask, it's important to consider that the human impact of a healthcare incident is a far greater lever that threat actors are using to achieve their financial and notoriety goals," he says. Kurt Osburn, director of risk management and governance at NCC Group, notes how healthcare is an easy target as well. "No healthcare attacks are surprising, unfortunately. The industry is a priority target for attackers because of the value of the information." Osburn says healthcare organizations must prioritize cybersecurity and make a more concerted effort to protect patient data privacy and security.
