Brazilian company Embraer, considered today's third-largest airplane maker after Boeing and Airbus, was the victim of a ransomware attack last month. Today, hackers involved in the intrusion have leaked some of the company's private files as revenge after the airplane maker refused to negotiate and instead chose to restore systems from backups without paying their ransom demand. Today's leak confirms that hackers managed to steal data from the company's servers. Embraer issued a press release last week, admitting to a security breach, but did not confirm that the incident involved neither ransomware nor data theft. An Embraer spokesperson did not return a request for comment sent by ZDNet today, following the leak. Embraer is also one of three companies that had their data leaked over the weekend on the RansomExx leak site, launched on Saturday. During negotiations, companies are told that if they don't pay the attacker's desired ransom demand, the attackers will leak data online as a form of punishment, so it can be downloaded by competitors, or that companies face regulatory punishments in their countries.
