The Russian state-sponsored cyber actor known as Midnight Blizzard has exfiltrated email correspondence between Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies and Microsoft through a successful compromise of Microsoft corporate email accounts. The threat actor is using information initially exfiltrated from the corporate email systems, including authentication details shared between Microsoft customers and Microsoft by email, to gain, or attempt to gain, additional access to Microsoft customer systems. Midnight Blizzard's successful compromise of Microsoft corporate email accounts and the exfiltration of correspondence between agencies and Microsoft presents a grave and unacceptable risk to agencies. CISA has assessed that the below required actions are most appropriate to understand and mitigate the risk posed by Midnight Blizzard's possession of the exfiltrated correspondence between FCEB agencies and Microsoft. Microsoft and CISA have notified all federal agencies whose email correspondence with Microsoft was identified as exfiltrated by Midnight Blizzard. Microsoft has represented to CISA that for the subset of affected agencies whose exfiltrated emails contain authentication secrets, such as credentials or passwords, Microsoft will provide metadata for such emails to those agencies. CISA Actions CISA will provide agencies with instructions for accessing the content of agency emails and analyzing the content of the email.
