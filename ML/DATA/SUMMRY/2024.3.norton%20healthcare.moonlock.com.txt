It has been about seven months since Norton Healthcare - a leading United States healthcare organization serving Greater Louisville, Southern Indiana, and Kentucky - first reported a security incident in May. Now, in December, the healthcare provider confirmed that the attack ended up compromising data from 2.5 million people. Data from current and former patients, employees, and dependents was stolen in the Norton Healthcare ransomware attack. Analysis of the exfiltrated sample made public by BlackCat revealed that Norton Healthcare's compromised data included personal and sensitive information of patients, images of checks and bank statements, and files with employees' personnel information such as names, dates of birth, and social security numbers. On December 9, as the copy of the notice to affected Maine residents featured by the Office of the Maine Attorney General reads, Norton Healthcare claims to have determined at a later date that the attack was ransomware. Norton Healthcare's letter of notice of the data breach, sent to those impacted, assures that they are enhancing security safeguards. The letter also adds that Norton Healthcare hired Kroll Monitoring, a provider of risk and financial solutions, to provide those impacted by the breach with 2 years of identity monitoring services at no cost. Norton Healthcare advised that those impacted by the breach visit Kroll Monitoring to activate their free identity monitoring services.
