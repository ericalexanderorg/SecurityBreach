The popular Italian hacktivist collective LulzSec ITA claimed via Twitter to have hacked three Italian universities. The popular Italian hacktivist collective LulzSec ITA has announced via Twitter the hack of three Italian universities, highlighting the importance of the cybersecurity for our society. The hacktivists claim that once hacked the universities did not disclose the data breach and attempted to hide the incident, violating the European Privacy Law GDPR. Below the translation of message published by the group. "Dear student / teacher friends, after a few months today we decided to focus our attention on you too :) We spent searching holes in Italian universities, to try to show you that security in the academic environment must be taken seriously since the university is the den of the excellent minds of our future. If the concept of security does not start from our schools, how can we have a better ruling class than the current one? Since our previous attacks did not bring any sense of shame on your part, we decided to let you taste another round, until you are able to admit how is ridiculous your security. Lulz!". Two weeks after the hack, one of the universities breached by the group, Uniparthenope, sent a data breach notification via email to the impacted students and teachers. LulzSec ITA told me that the notification attempted to downplay the incident, despite the hacktivists claim to have accessed data contained in 27 databases and compromised some portals used by the university. It is embarrassing that universities could be hacked with a so simple technique.
