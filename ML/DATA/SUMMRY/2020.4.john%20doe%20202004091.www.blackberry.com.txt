APT Groups Coordinating: Persistent threats rarely operate in a single domain, and the five groups assessed to be related to the APT originally identified as WINNTI GROUP in previously published research are no exception. The APT groups examined include the original WINNTI GROUP, PASSCV, BRONZE UNION, CASPER, and a newly identified group BlackBerry researchers are tracking as WLNXSPLINTER. All five groups are assessed to be related given the distinct similarities in their tools, tactics and procedures employed and referred to in this report as the WINNTI approach. BlackBerry researchers lay bare how a quintet of APT groups acting in the interest of the Chinese government - assessed to be offshoots of the original WINNTI GROUP developed the capability to exploit the "Alwayson, always available" nature of Linux servers to establish an operations beachhead in targeted networks while remaining almost entirely undetected for nearly a decade. In 2014, Kaspersky discovered that the Russian group TURLA was also deploying Linux malware, and another group Kaspersky identifies as THE EQUATION GROUP has also targeted Linux servers extensively. 9 WINNTI Splinter Cell Targeting Linux BlackBerry researchers have assessed that there are at least five APT groups acting in the interest of the Chinese government which together comprise a "Splinter cell" that targets enterprise Linux distributions, all of which are related to one another and to an APT identified in earlier research as WINNNTI GROUP. For the first time, BlackBerry researchers have assessed that these groups are all sharing a previously unidentified Linux malware toolset referred to in this report as the WINNTILNX toolset. All five groups share tools, suggesting several possible scenarios: a formal "Digital quartermaster" arrangement; an informal "Hacker forum" type of toolswap; personnel overlap between the groups; or a re-tasking of the same groups toward different target sets.
