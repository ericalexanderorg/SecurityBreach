Low-cost energy supplier People's Energy has suffered a data breach affecting every one of its 270,000 customers in the UK. The breach was discovered on 16 December when an unauthorised third party gained access to one of the systems used to store some of the members' data. The company has since informed the Information Commissioner's Office and the energy industry regulator, Ofgem. According to the company, cyber criminals managed to access the names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, People's Energy account numbers, tariff details, and gas and electricity meter identification numbers of all customers. "Details for all our members were accessed," an email sent to customers read. "This includes both current members and former members who've used us as their energy supplier in the past. We're doing everything we can to contact everyone affected to explain what's happened. We've informed the Information Commissioner's Office and the energy industry regulator, Ofgem. We're following their guidance, and are keeping them updated on the situation." "We take keeping your data safe extremely seriously. Right now, we're working with a dedicated external security team to add additional protection to our systems. Your financial data is kept in a separate system with enhanced security." Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech.com, told IT Pro that People's Energy customers should be on the lookout for targeted phishing messages from fraudsters posing as People's Energy or a related company.
