The backdoor contain narrow capabilities: download and upload files, run commands and send the attackers the results. The backdoor utilizes Dropbox as a C&C server, by sending and receiving commands written to a specific folder in a specially created Dropbox account, prepared by the attacker before the operation. The backdoor uses the Dropbox API with a hardcoded bearer access token and has the ability to download, upload, and execute files. In the initialization stage, the backdoor creates a unique folder for the victim in an attacker-controlled Dropbox account. The folder is named by the victim's MAC address which is obtained using GetAdaptersInfo API. Fig 3: Creation of a folder in Dropbox by the backdoor and stackstrings obfuscation. Every few seconds the backdoor sends a POST request to the C&C URL. In the response, the malware searches for a specific pattern: it takes the string between <!-|# and #|-> , decodes it, and executes the command. In this case, we observed a cyber-espionage operation focusing on governmental agencies in Central Asia, being targeted with the Poison Ivy and xCaon backdoors, along with the newly discovered BoxCaon backdoor variant - whose C&C communication capability was updated to utilize the Dropbox service itself as the C&C infrastructure of the operation.
