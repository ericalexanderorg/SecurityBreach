Travelex reportedly paid a $2.3 million ransom payment to get their systems back online after being encrypted by a Sodinokibi ransomware attack. To recover their files, the threat actors told us that they demanded a $3 million ransom and would publicly release the stolen data if the ransom was not paid. At the time, the ransomware operators felt that Travelex would not pay and began to post threats on hacker forums that they would release their data if not paid. A new report by the Wall Street Journal states that they were able to confirm that Travelex paid a 2.3 million ransom to get their network back up and running. This report also aligns with information that BleepingComputer was told when Travelex resumed operations on January 17th, 2020 and rumors began circulating that Travelex paid the ransom. "There is an ongoing investigation. We have taken advice from a number of experts and we are not going to discuss this," Travelex told BleepingComputer. While paying the ransom may have restored Travelex's network, for those whose data was potentially compromised, they are just stuck in limbo.
