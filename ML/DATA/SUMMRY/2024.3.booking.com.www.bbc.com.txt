Hackers are increasing their attacks on Booking.com customers by posting adverts on dark web forums asking for help finding victims. A Booking.com spokesman said the company is aware that some of its accommodation partners are being targeted by hackers "Using a host of known cyber-fraud tactics". Then the hackers log into the Booking.com portal allowing them to see all customers who currently have room or holiday reservations. The hackers then message customers from the official app and are able to trick people into paying money to them instead of the hotel. Hackers appear to be making so much money in their attacks that they are now offering to pay thousands to criminals who share access to hotel portals. A Booking.com spokesman said: "While this breach was not on Booking.com, we understand the seriousness for those impacted, which is why our teams work diligently to support our partners in securing their systems as quickly as possible and helping any potentially impacted customers accordingly, including with recovering any lost funds." "Booking.com has started displaying a warning message on the bottom of chat windows, but they could be doing much more than this. For instance, not allowing any links to be included in chat which go to websites that are less than a few days old would prevent freshly-made fake sites being used to trick customers into paying," he said.
