A U.S. government website was vandalized late Saturday by hackers who posted images of a bloodied President Donald Trump being punched in the face and pro-Iran messages. The hackers, who struck as tensions between the U.S. and Iran heat up, claimed to be "Iran cyber security group hackers," however, there's no evidence to confirm any attribution to Iran at the moment, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Conflict between the U.S. and Iran peaked after U.S. drones on Jan. 3 killed Qassem Soleimani, an Iranian general with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who was highly-esteemed in Iran. The U.S. remains on edge about future cyberthreats that Iranian hackers could pose. In a bulletin released on Friday, the DHS said that Iran "Maintains a robust cyber program and can execute cyber attacks against the United States." Security experts say one particularly worrisome cyberthreat from Iran is the deployment of destructive wiper malware - which has the singular purpose of destroying systems or data, usually causing great financial and reputational damage to victim companies. Iranian hackers have leveraged wiper malware in destructive attacks several times over the past years.
