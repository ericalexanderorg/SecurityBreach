On Sunday, Motherboard reported that the hacker or hackers known as Phineas Fisher targeted a bank, stole money and documents, and is offering other hackers $100,000 to carry out politically motivated hacks. Now, the bank Phineas Fisher targeted, Cayman National Bank from the Isle of Man, confirmed it has suffered a data breach. "It is known that Cayman National Bank Limited was amongst a number of banks targeted and subject to the same hacking activity," Cayman National told Motherboard in a statement issued Monday. The statement doesn't name Phineas Fisher explicitly, but instead says the bank was the victim of a "Criminal hacking group." "I robbed a bank and gave the money away," Phineas Fisher wrote in their most recent manifesto, adding that they breached the bank in 2016. Phineas Fisher provided stolen documents and emails from the bank to leaking website Distributed Denial of Secrets, run by activist Emma Best. Phineas Fisher most notoriously breached Italian surveillance vendor Hacking Team, before releasing a trove of internal company documents and files online.
