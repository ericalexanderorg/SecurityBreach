Two weeks ago, New Relic became aware of unauthorized access to our staging environment, an internal environment that provides visibility into how our customers are using New Relic and certain logs. The unauthorized actor used the stolen credentials to gain access to our staging environment, where they were able to view certain data pertaining to our customers' use of New Relic. There is no indication of lateral movement from our staging environment to any customers' New Relic accounts in the separate production environment or to New Relic's production infrastructure. Although our investigation is ongoing, we aim to take a security forward posture by sharing our learnings to support the broader New Relic community. New Relic offers automatic controls over how users are added to New Relic, how they're managed, and how they log in. As an additional security measure, you should regularly audit the changes made in your New Relic environment - particularly when you suspect unusual activity. We will continue to make security investments in our infrastructure and product offering to maintain a strong security posture for our New Relic community.
