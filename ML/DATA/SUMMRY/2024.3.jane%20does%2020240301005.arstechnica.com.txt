Hackers backed by the North Korean government gained a major win when Microsoft left a Windows zero-day unpatched for six months after learning it was under active exploitation. Even after Microsoft patched the vulnerability last month, the company made no mention that the North Korean threat group Lazarus had been using the vulnerability since at least August to install a stealthy rootkit on vulnerable computers. Microsoft has long said that such admin-to-kernel elevations don't represent the crossing of a security boundary, a possible explanation for the time Microsoft took to fix the vulnerability. The Microsoft policy proved to be a boon to Lazarus in installing "FudModule," a custom rootkit that Avast said was exceptionally stealthy and advanced. Sys, a driver enabling the Windows AppLocker service, which comes preinstalled in the Microsoft OS. Avast said such vulnerabilities represent the "Holy grail," as compared to BYOVD. In August, Avast researchers sent Microsoft a description of the zero-day, along with proof-of-concept code that demonstrated what it did when exploited. Microsoft didn't patch the vulnerability until last month. A day later, Microsoft updated its patch bulletin to note the exploitation.
