A day after Canon was suspected of becoming the latest high-profile victim of a ransomware attack, an internal employee communique admitting just that has been leaked to media. According to Bleeping Computer, the camera-maker has circulated a note to employees confirming that ransomware is to blame for outages across its main U.S. website, email, collaboration platforms and various internal systems. "Access to some Canon systems is currently unavailable as a result of a ransomware incident we recently discovered. This is unrelated to the recent issue which affected image.canon." The Canon USA website was still not up at the time of this writing, with a previous "The site is undergoing temporary maintenance" splash page now replaced with a picture of a hot-air balloon and the text, "Our heads aren't in the clouds. We're just busy updating our site. Please check back soon! In the Meantime [sic], please visit us at: Canon Online Store or Canon Forum." As the page indicates, other Canon assets, including its global website, appear to be unaffected, potentially meaning that the consumer-electronics giant's security included working failsafe measures to limit the damage. Canon can count itself a rarity, according to researchers: "In our ethical hacking engagements we are typically able to gain complete control of networks in one to three days and the presence of security products rarelyprevent us from exploiting computer systems," Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at Cerberus Sentinel, said via email. The large-electronics-vendor-hit-by-ransomware situation is eerily similar to the recent attack on Garmin, which was the work of the WastedLocker ransomware and Evil Corp. In that case, the GPS specialist reportedly paid a multimillion-dollar ransom to retrieve its files.
