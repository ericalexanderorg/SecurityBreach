LockBit is back extorting victims on the dark web a week after a major international law enforcement taskforce knocked the prolific ransomware gang's operations offline. Despite authorities seizing servers, cryptocurrency and decryption keys in the raid, a weekend post purportedly from the gang's leader claimed LockBit had retained access to its victims' stolen data. As part of the multi-country Operation Cronos taskforce that took down LockBit, authorities seized a number of dark web sites run by the gang, including the leak site it used to post victim details and extortion demands. Over the weekend a new dark web LockBit leak site appeared, with a victim list that included Fulton County and the FBI. There is no evidence to suggest LockBit had actually hacked the FBI, but the listing included a rambling 2800-word post claiming to be written by the gang's leader, "LockBitSupp". According to the gang's new leak site, Fulton County's deadline to pay a ransom is March 2. Last week authorities posted a message on one of the gang's websites they had taken over - "Who is LockBitSupp?" - suggesting they would reveal the gang leader's identity when a countdown timer on the site expired on Feb. 23. Cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs contacted a person believed to be LockbitSupp on the Tox instant messaging platform and asked if they thought the FBI new their identity.
