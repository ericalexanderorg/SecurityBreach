The Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen is recovering following an attempted ransomware attack which caused a halt in their services. The RDOS suffered an attempted ransomware attack in August, halting services. The organization assured that there is "No indication" any personal information was released as a result of the attempted ransomware attack. A ransomware attack involves a malicious software that infects computer systems and displays messages demanding a fee for a fix. Ransomware is commonly installed through deceptive links in an email or website. The RDOS says they won't know the total cost of the attack until their network is fully restored. "The RDOS has cyber insurance which is covering the bulk of the costs associated with responding to the attempted ransomware attack," explained the RDOS in an email.
