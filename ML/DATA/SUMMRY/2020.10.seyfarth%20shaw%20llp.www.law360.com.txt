Law360 - The recent ransomware attack against Seyfarth Shaw LLP should be a wake-up call for law firms to rethink their cybersecurity strategies and policies, as the shift to remote work caused by the coronavirus pandemic is making firms more vulnerable than ever, cybersecurity experts say. In an update Thursday, Seyfarth said it still found "No evidence that any client or firm data was either accessed or removed" in the Oct. 10 ransomware incident. In Seyfarth's case, the firm was able to stop the attack soon after detection, but not until after many of its systems, including email, were encrypted by malware, according to the firm. Such encryption means Seyfarth cannot access its files without the decryption keys, and the firm either has to pay the attacker to regain access or restore its data from a backup. "I think you have to applaud Seyfarth for owning it and for being upfront, right?" said Frank Gillman, a former BigLaw chief information officer who now works at consulting firm Vertex Advisors. Especially during the coronavirus pandemic, when most of the workforce is working from home, law firms' "Attack surface," or ways hackers can access and steal data, is extended far beyond the traditional office-based infrastructure, Gillman added. As for how to prevent cyberattacks, Hasenstab recommends that law firms of all sizes implement multifactor authentication for important information and create "a culture of inclusion" that puts cybersecurity in the firm's risk management portfolio, including cyber insurance.
