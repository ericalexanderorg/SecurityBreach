According to recent reports, cloud hosting and IT services provider Netgain, which bills itself as "The industry standard for secure and scalable IT-as-a-Service for accounting and healthcare," has been forced to take some of its data centers offline after suffering a recent ransomware attack. Apparently, Netgain first suffered or discovered the attack on November 24, 2020, and began reporting potential "System outages or slowdowns" as of December 4. On December 5, Netgain further reported that it had taken "a number of [its] data centers offline." Subsequently, on December 8, 2020, Netgain customer Crystal Practice Management e-mailed its optometry and vision-therapy clients, indicating that many of Netgain's servers were still down and that the ransomware attack affected Netgain's domain controllers, which organize or respond to security authentication requests for thousands of Netgain servers across several locations. As a result of this news, we encourage you to confer with your information-technology personnel to determine if your organization might have been affected by this incident. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.
