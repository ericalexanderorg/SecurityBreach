The Japanese publisher confirmed it had been the victim of such an attack back in November, warning that personal information, sales reports and other financial data, and information on upcoming game releases had been compromised by an organisation called Ragnar Locker. At the time, the company said the personal information of nine current and former employees had been accessed, and that a maximum of 350,000 people - including business partners, former employees and customers - may have been affected. A release offering an update on the situation now reveals that 16,406 people have had their personal information compromised. Information compromised includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses and HR information. Capcom has reiterated that no credit card information has been affected, since all online transactions are handled by a third-party service provider. Capcom is in the process of contacting those who have been verified to be affected by the attack, and will continue to investigate the personal information that may also have been in danger. The release includes contact information for its Japan, North America and EMEA support desks for those who are concerned their information may have been compromised.
