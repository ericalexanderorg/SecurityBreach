The documents, filed by The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in the Australian Federal Court, relate to the October, 2022, breach of Medibank that resulted in the personal data of 9.7 million of its customers being stolen and released on the dark web. The docs showed that an employee of a Medibank third-party IT contractor saved their Medibank username and password to their personal internet browser profile on the work computer they used for Medibank. In August 2022, the worker's Medibank credentials were stolen from their personal computer by a threat actor, who was then was able to log onto Medibank's Microsoft Exchange server and use the credentials for the Admin Account, which accessed most of Medibank's systems. Once done, the threat actor could log onto Medibank's "Global Protect" VPN, which controlled remote access to the Medibank corporate network. It wasn't as if Medibank didn't know about its cyber security shortcomings. A pen test of Medibank's OSHC web environment in March 2018 identified weaknesses in Medibank's cybersecurity framework, including insecure or weak password requirements for accessing its systems. An internal Medibank presentation prepared in early 2022 showed that security controls and a control review process and timeline prepared in 2020 were never implemented.
