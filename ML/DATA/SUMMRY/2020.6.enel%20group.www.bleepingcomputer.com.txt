European energy company giant Enel Group suffered a ransomware attack a few days ago that impacted its internal network. Detected on June 7, the incident is the work of EKANS ransomware operators, the group that also targeted Honda earlier this week. Enel Group confirmed for BleepingComputer that its internal IT network was disrupted on Sunday evening following a ransomware attack caught by their antivirus before the malware could spread. Dealing with the incident required isolating the corporate network for a limited time, "To carry out all interventions aimed at eliminating any residual risk." All connectivity was safely restored on early Monday morning, the company says. Enel did not comment on the name of the ransomware used in the attack but security researcher Milkream found an SNAKE/EKANS sample submitted to VirusTotal on June 7 that shows that it checks for the domain "Enelint.global". The same domain connected to Enel addresses in the U.S. and Italy, the latter pointing to sites localized for countries where the company does business. According to statements from both companies, the attack from Snake ransomware was unsuccessful. This was later confirmed by analysis from industrial cybersecurity company Dragos, who confirmed that Snake ransomware was the first in its category to target industrial control system operations.
