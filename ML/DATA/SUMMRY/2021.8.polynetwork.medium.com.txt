In the past few days, Poly Network has completed the second phase of "Mainnet Upgrade" as per the set roadmap, and we have maintained contact with Mr. White Hat communicating the progress on a daily basis. We have made constant efforts to establish an understanding with Mr. White Hat and genuinely hope that Mr. White Hat will transfer the private keys as soon as possible so that we can return full asset control back to the users at the earliest. Mr. White Hat shared his concerns about Poly Network's security and overall development strategy in a recent public dialogue. To extend our thanks and encourage Mr. White Hat to continue contributing to security advancement in the blockchain world together with Poly Network, we cordially invite Mr. White Hat to be the Chief Security Advisor of Poly Network. As we have stated in previous announcements and encrypted messages that have been made public, we are grateful for Mr. White Hat's outstanding contribution to Poly Network's security enhancements. While there were certain misunderstandings in the beginning due to poor communication channels, we now understand Mr. White Hat's vision for Defi and the crypto world, which is in line with Poly Network's ambitions from the very beginning - to provide interoperability for ledgers in Web 3.0.Poly Network previously promised to reward Mr. White Hat with a $500,000 bug bounty, but he did not accept it and has publicly stated that he has considered offering it to the technical community who have made contributions to blockchain security. We fully respect Mr. White Hat's thoughts, and to express our gratitude, we will still transfer this $500,000 bounty to a wallet address approved by Mr. White Hat for him to use it at his own discretion for the cause of cybersecurity and supporting more projects and individuals.
