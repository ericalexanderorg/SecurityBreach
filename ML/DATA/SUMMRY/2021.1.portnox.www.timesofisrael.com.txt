The hacking group Pay2Key, which has been linked to Iran, said Thursday it hacked the computer systems of the Israeli cyber security company Portnox, days after the same group hacked Israel Aerospace Industries. The hacks were the latest in a series of cyberattacks on Israeli firms in recent months. Israeli cyber security firm Check Point issued a warning about Pay2Key in November after a series of attacks on Israeli companies. The hacking group installs ransomware in its victims' networks, which allows hackers to take control of data or systems, and threatens to leak corporate data, then demands Bitcoins as a ransom payment, the warning said. The Israeli cyber security firm ClearSky, which released a report on Pay2Key three days before the alleged IAI hack, said the group was likely an offshoot of an Iranian hacking cooperative known as Fox Kitten. "We estimate with a medium level of confidence that this campaign is part of Iran information warfare aimed to create panic to Israel and in other countries world-wide," the cyber security company said. The alleged hack of the Elta subsidiary came after a major cyberattack - also by Pay2Key, according to ClearSky - earlier this month hit dozens of Israeli logistics companies, with hackers making off with information from servers, according to a report of the incident by one of the victims, Amital Data, filed to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
