Ticketmaster has started sending out warnings to customers that their personal information has been stolen. At the end of May, criminals claimed that they had stolen the data of 560 million Ticketmaster customers. Ticketmaster did not issue a public warning but did inform the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that a "Third-party cloud environment" had been breached and that company data and personal information had been stolen. Several security experts suggested - in collaboration with the alleged perpetrator - that the data had been stolen via Snowflake's cloud platform. At the very least, this indicates that the stolen data includes phone numbers and email addresses. When reporting to the Attorney General, companies often report the number of people affected during a data breach. According to the same sources who provided samples of the stolen data, the affected data includes full names, physical addresses, email addresses, credit card numbers, telephone numbers, and financial history on the platform.
