On Thursday, December 13th 2018, we became aware that some information about Blur users had been potentially exposed and immediately began working to ensure our systems and data were secure, to determine what happened, and to inform and help our users. Each user's last and second-to-last IP addresses used to login to Blur.Each user's encrypted Blur password. As a best practice, you should change your Blur password. If you use the same password you use on Blur on any other service, you should change those passwords to new unique passwords as well. To change your password, click "Edit" next to your password in your Blur Settings. You should also take this opportunity to ensure your new Blur password is long, but something you can remember, and that you have your Blur backup passphrase as well. You should use multi-factor authentication for your Blur account to add an extra layer of security to your account.
