Food delivery service DoorDash disclosed a data breach that affects almost 5 million customers, drivers and merchants using its platform. DoorDash, an on-demand food delivery service, connects end users with local restaurants and relies on contracted drivers who use their own vehicles for delivery, also known as "Dashers." The company said on Thursday that users who joined its app-based service on or before April 5, 2018 are impacted - totaling 4.9 million consumers, restaurants who operated through the service, and "Dashers." A variety of personal data was accessed including names, email addresses, delivery addresses, phone numbers and hashed passwords. The company said that in September, it discovered an unauthorized third party accessed some DoorDash user data on May 4, 2019. DoorDash did not specify the source of the breach, but did say that it involved a "Third-party service provider." The company said it is in the process of notifying those affected "As quickly as possible and will continue to reach out over the coming days" - however, in the meantime it also encourages users to reset their passwords to one unique to DoorDash. Moving forward, DoorDash said that it will take future steps to improve the security of its platform.
