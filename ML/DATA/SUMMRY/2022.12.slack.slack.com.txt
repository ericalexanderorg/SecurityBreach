We recently became aware of a security issue involving unauthorized access to a subset of Slack's code repositories. Upon investigation, we discovered that a limited number of Slack employee tokens were stolen and misused to gain access to our externally hosted GitHub repository. No downloaded repositories contained customer data, means to access customer data, or Slack's primary codebase. Our current findings show that the threat actor did not access other areas of Slack's environment, including the production environment, and they did not access other Slack resources or customer data. Based on currently available information, the unauthorized access did not result from a vulnerability inherent to Slack. We are also working with our vendors and security partners to ensure that tokens used to access any Slack repositories are stored safely and securely. FAQ. What is a code repository?A code repository is a library of software code.
