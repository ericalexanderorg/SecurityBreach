New Jersey Attorney General General Gurbir S. Grewal and the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs have announced a settlement has been reached with Wakefern Food Corporation to settle allegations of violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and multiple violations of the state fraud act. Wakefern Food Corporation is the parent company of Union Lake Supermarket, LLC which owns a ShopRite supermarket in Millville New Jersey and ShopRite Supermarkets, Inc., which owns a ShopRite store in Kingston, NY. Wakefern Food Corporation replaced two electronic devices used to record customer information and signatures at the pharmacies in those two stores and disposed of the old devices in regular dumpsters. HIPAA Rules require all electronic protected health information to be permanently and securely deleted prior to disposal or for devices that contain ePHI to be destroyed to render any stored data unrecoverable. The investigation by the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs determined appropriate training had not been provided to staff at the pharmacies on HIPAA regulations and the protection of customer data, there were violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule including the lack of business associate agreements with the supermarkets and pharmacies, and several violations of state laws related to the improper disposal of sensitive data. The settlement requires Wakefern Food Corporation to pay $209,856. Those measures include Wakefern appointing a chief privacy officer and ensuring that ShopRite Supermarkets, Union Lake, and members who operate the pharmacies in the supermarkets sign business associate agreements and implement measures to protect customer data and policies and procedures to comply with the HIPAA Rules. "This settlement ensures that ShopRite supermarket pharmacies will be trained and monitored for HIPAA compliance to avoid future conduct that place consumers at risk for privacy invasion and identity theft."
