An election application used by Israel's Likud party has exposed the personal information of over 6 million voters. Likud, the party of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has contracted a company named Feed-b to create an election management system called Elector, which has been advertised as highly secure. Developer and journalist Ran Bar-Zik discovered that the source code of the Elector website, which could easily be accessed by anyone from a browser using the "View page source" option, included administrator credentials. According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, political parties are provided a copy of the voter registry leading up to an election, but they cannot share it with third parties and they have to erase the information after the election. In this case, Likud's application exposed 6,453,254 voter records, including names, identity card numbers, addresses and, in some cases, phone numbers and family information. This is not the first time someone has exposed a voter database. Similar incidents reported in the past few years involved voters in the United States, Mexico and the Philippines.
