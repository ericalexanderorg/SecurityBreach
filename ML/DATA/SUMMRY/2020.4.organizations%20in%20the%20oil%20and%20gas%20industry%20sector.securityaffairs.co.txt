Hackers launched spear-phishing attacks against organizations in the oil and gas industry sector spreading the Agent Tesla info-stealer malware. Crooks are targeting organizations in the oil and gas industry sector with targeted spearphishing campaigns impersonating shipment companies and engineering contractors. Experts pointed out that this is the first time that Agent Tesla has been employed in attacks targeting the oil and gas vertical. The experts continue to observe a spike in the number of attacks against oil & gas, as the global COVID-19 pandemic lowered oil demand. "However, a disruptive dispute over oil production between Russia and Saudi Arabia ended with an agreement at the recent meeting between the OPEC+ alliance and the Group of 20 nations, aiming to slash oil production output and balance prices." reads the analysis published by Bitdefender. Experts tracked several attacks, in a spearphishing campaign the attackers either impersonated a well-known Egyptian engineering contractor or a shipment company. "However, these campaigns seem to deliver the Agent Tesla spyware Trojan instead, and beyond just the oil & gas sector, they also target other energy verticals that have been tagged as critical during this Coronavirus pandemic." continues the analysis.
