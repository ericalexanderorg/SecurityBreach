Threat actors claim to be selling 3TB of data from Advance Auto Parts, a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider, stolen after breaching the company's Snowflake account. The threat actor selling Advance's data for $1.5 million on a hacking forum told BleepingComputer that the data had been stolen in recent attacks targeting cloud storage company Snowflake customers since at least mid-April 2024. The threat actor also told BleepingComputer that the automotive company is not the only Snowflake customer whose data was exfiltrated. As first shared by threat intel company HackManac, the leaked data contains numerous references to 'SNOWFLAKE,' corroborating the threat actor's claim that it was stolen in the recent Snowflake data theft attacks. On Friday, TicketMaster's parent company, Live Nation, confirmed that a data breach hit the ticketing firm after its Snowflake account was compromised on May 20. Mandiant's investigations also indicate that the attackers are likely using credentials stolen by information-stealing malware to access the victims' Snowflake tenants and steal data. Europol confirms web portal breach, says no operational data stolen.
