The Surrey School District has confirmed the number of students whose personal data, including social insurance numbers, was posted publicly on the district website is greater than initially reported. Last month, a student alerted Peace Arch News that the district posted private student information on the Surrey Schools website. The Surrey School District confirmed to PAN that 67 students had their scholarship applications "Inadvertently" posted on the school district's website from April 19 to May 6. Following the publication of an article about the incident, a parent reached out to PAN and said more students were affected by the incident than what was reported. The parent also said that the personal information was posted publicly for nearly a year. This week, Surrey Schools communication manager Ritinder Matthew confirmed that "Upon further investigation" the district's privacy office found an additional 111 applications that were mistakenly posted on its website. In letters addressed to the parents of affected students, the district said it made arrangements with Trans Union of Canada to provide credit monitoring services for a 12-month period to all affected students.
