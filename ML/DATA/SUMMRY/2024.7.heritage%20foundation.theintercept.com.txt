SiegedSec, a collective of self-proclaimed "Gay furry hackers," has claimed credit for breaching online databases of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that spearheaded the right-wing Project 2025 playbook. On Wednesday, as part of string of hacks aimed at organizations that oppose transgender rights, SiegedSec released a cache of Heritage Foundation material. "We're strongly against Project 2025 and everything the Heritage Foundation stands for," one of SiegedSec's leaders, who goes by the handle "Vio," told The Intercept. In its Telegram post, SiegedSec said it obtained passwords and other user information for "Every user" of a Heritage Foundation database, including Roberts and some U.S. government employees. In April, Heritage shut down its network following a cyberattack tentatively attributed to nation-state hackers. SiegedSec targeted the Heritage Foundation in early June, according to vio, who denied involvement in the earlier attack. A spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation declined to comment on the breach.
