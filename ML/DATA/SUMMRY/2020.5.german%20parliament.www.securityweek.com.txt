Germany said Thursday it is seeking EU sanctions against a Russian man over his alleged role in the hacking of the German parliament at a time when evidence shows he was working for Russian intelligence. Germany's Foreign Ministry said it called in Russian ambassador Sergei Nechayev to inform him in person of the move. Berger told Nechayev that Germany would be pursuing EU sanctions against Russian citizen Dmitriy Badin, and possibly others, under a new regime established last year to respond to cyberattacks, the ministry said. The Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament's lower house, called the German accusations "Baseless." Russian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement by Moscow in the hacking attack. Prosecutors have suggested the hit was ordered either by Moscow or authorities in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Russian national Vadim Sokolov was arrested near the scene and is accused of carrying out the killing with official help.
