Chicago-based transportation technology firm Rand McNally is working on restoring network functionality following a cyberattack that hit its systems earlier this week. Rand McNally is an American company founded in 1856 that provides leading route mileage optimization and fleet management software to carriers, shipping companies, and third-party logistics providers. In a separate notification sent to customers on Tuesday, Rand McNally said that no indication of customer data being affected in the cyberattack. Earlier today, Rand McNally sent a new email notification to users of its electronic logging devices saying that the cyberattack affected only its hosted and network systems. In a statement shared with Land Line, a Rand McNally spokesperson said that the company's ELD platform was down and suggested the use of paper-based logging until the affected systems are restored. Although Rand McNally made no official statement regarding this, the cyberattack currently affecting its systems shows all the signs of a ransomware attack starting with large scale operational disruption and the ongoing efforts toward network restoration. BleepingComputer has reached out to Rand McNally for additional info regarding the attack but had not heard back at the time of this publication.
