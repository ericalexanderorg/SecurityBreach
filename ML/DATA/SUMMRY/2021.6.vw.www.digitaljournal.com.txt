Customers were not contacted until June 19, 2021, despite the potential for personally indefinable information having been exposed. News of the incident comes via letter that was sent to customers of Audi Canada impacted by the unprecedented cybersecurity breach, dated on June 19. The letter comes from Vito Paladino, President of Audi Canada Inc. While the letter does not detail how the cybersecurity breach occurred, it does indicate that the data breach was of a wide impact and this has led to personally identifiable information being exposed. The letter to customers states: "The investigation confirmed that the third party obtained limited personal information received from or about customers and interested buyers from a vendor used by Audi, Volkswagen, and some authorized dealers in the United States and Canada". Companies are legally obligated under GDPR to inform if they suffer a breach involving personal information of customers or employees. The letter provides a warning to customers about suspicious emails and advises customers not to provide personal data to any one making an inquiry. For consumers to feel more comfortable about passing on their personal details, companies such as Audi need to take security and customer care a little more seriously.
