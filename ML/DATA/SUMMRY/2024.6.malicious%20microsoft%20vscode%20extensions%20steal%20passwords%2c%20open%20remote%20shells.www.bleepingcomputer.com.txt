Cybercriminals are starting to target Microsoft's VSCode Marketplace, uploading three malicious Visual Studio extensions that Windows developers downloaded 46,600 times. According to Check Point, whose analysts discovered the malicious extensions and reported them to Microsoft, the malware enabled the threat actors to steal credentials, system information, and establish a remote shell on the victim's machine. Any software developers still using the malicious extensions must manually remove them from their systems and run a complete scan to detect any remnants of the infection. Microsoft also operates an extensions market for the IDE called the VSCode Marketplace, which offers over 50,000 add-ons that extend the application's functionality and provide more customization options. 'Theme Darcula dark' - Described as "An attempt to improve Dracula colors consistency on VS Code," this extension was used to steal basic information about the developer's system, including hostname, operating system, CPU platform, total memory, and information about the CPU. While the extension did not contain other malicious activity, it is not typical behavior associated with a theme pack. While VSCode Marketplace is just starting to be targeted, AquaSec demonstrated in January that it was fairly easy to upload malicious extensions to the VSCode Marketplace and presented some highly suspicious cases. The cases discovered by Check Point demonstrate that threat actors are now actively attempting to infect Windows developers with malicious submissions, precisely like they do in other software repositories such as the NPM and PyPI. Users of the VSCode Marketplace, and all user-supported repositories, are advised to only install extensions from trusted publishers with many downloads and community ratings, read user reviews, and always inspect the extension's source code before installing it.
