A National Crime Agency Investigation into a ransomware attack at Redcar and Cleveland Council remains 'live', Government officials have said. Council leader Mary Lanigan previously threatened to take a plea for cash help direct to ministers' doors in London after several weeks of talks with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government which have yet to reach a conclusion. The council has been asked to carry out due diligence in an attempt to establish the exact costs of recovering its systems. The cyber attack in February took the council's website offline, knocked out IT systems used by staff and scrambled files and data. "A Government spokesman told the Local Democracy Service:"We responded swiftly to a recent cyber incident that affected Redcar and Cleveland Council and worked closely with them to provide advice and support so they maintained frontline services to protect the safety and wellbeing of the most vulnerable people in the community. "We will continue our engagement with the council to help them recover from this incident as quickly as possible." "The council has already received an additional Â£8.58m to tackle the pressures they have told us they are facing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic."
