Because of the hashing and encryption methods we use to protect our customers, it would be extremely difficult to attempt to brute force guess master passwords for those customers who follow our password best practices. To further increase the security of your master password, LastPass utilizes a stronger-than-typical implementation of 100,100 iterations of the Password-Based Key Derivation Function, a password-strengthening algorithm that makes it difficult to guess your master password. If you reuse your master password and that password was ever compromised, a threat actor may use dumps of compromised credentials that are already available on the Internet to attempt to access your account. On August 25th, 2022, we notified you about a security incident that was limited to the LastPass Development environment in which some of our source code and technical information was taken. Thirdly, LastPass does not have any access to the master passwords of our customers' vaults - without the master password, it is not possible for anyone other than the owner of a vault to decrypt vault data as part of our Zero Knowledge security model. After initiating an immediate investigation, we have seen no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data or encrypted password vaults. Has my Master password or the Master Password of my users been compromised?
