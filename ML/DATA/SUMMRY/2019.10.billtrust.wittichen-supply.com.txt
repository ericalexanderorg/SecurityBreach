This morning, BillTrust communicated to us that our/your data has not been compromised and they are working around the clock to restore service levels. Due to the volume of data and the need to exercise extreme caution, BillTrust plans to restore services on a measured schedule. As of Friday, October 18th - 8:30AM CST, BillTrust does not have an ETA on the restoration of service. We appreciate your patience and will keep you updated as we learn more from BillTrust. Wittichen Supply is still waiting for communication from BillTrust that they are ready to accept data transmission. Monday, Oct. 21 - 8:00 A.M. CST. Billtrust systems continue to come back online, and we are in the process of catching up the missing data from the outage. We hope to have invoices and payments from the 17th - 20th uploaded to BillTrust soon.
