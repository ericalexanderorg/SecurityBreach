Mobile health app Babylon, which states its company mission as putting "An accessible and affordable health service in the hands of every person on earth", has admitted to a software bug that went one step further than that. According to a BBC report, an app user in the UK ended up with other people's health service data in his hands. The user, named by the BBC as Rory Glover from Leeds in England, apparently used the app to check up on a prescription of his own, only to find that the "Consultation Replays" feature of the app contained a list of 50 videos for him to review. Clicking on one of them made the nature of the unexpected videos clear: it was a recording of someone else's video chat with a doctor made via the service. As far as we can tell, Babylon acted quickly to remove the rogue videos from Glover's "Replays" gallery, as well as reporting itself to the Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's privacy and data protection authority. We don't yet know how many different patients' videos were on the lists that were exposed, but Babylon has blamed the blunder on a "New feature" whereby someone talking to a doctor via the app can switch up to video mode during the call. What to do? If you're a Babylon app user, there doesn't seem to be anything you need to do - as far as we can tell, the problem was caused by a bug on the server side, meaning that fixing it could be handled centrally without an app update.
