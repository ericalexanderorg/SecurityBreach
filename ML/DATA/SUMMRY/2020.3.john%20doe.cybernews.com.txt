The CyberNews research team uncovered an unsecured database owned by an unidentified party, comprising 800 gigabytes of personal user information. The database in question was left on a publicly accessible server and contained more than 200 million detailed user records, putting an astonishing number of people at risk. On March 3, 2020, the entirety of the data present on the database was wiped by an unidentified party. The unsecured database contained a folder that included more than 200 million incredibly detailed records of what looked like profiles of US users. Due to how the data in the main folder was structured our analysts suspect that the database belonged to a data marketing firm or a credit company. While it's unclear if any malicious actors have accessed the database before the wipe on March 3 or if the data was erased by a blackhat hacker, anyone who knew where to look could have accessed the data, without needing any kind of authentication. It's difficult to understate the massive effect this data leak can have on hundreds of millions of people in the US. The data exposed by the unidentified party is a virtual gold mine for anyone with a penchant for cybercrime.
