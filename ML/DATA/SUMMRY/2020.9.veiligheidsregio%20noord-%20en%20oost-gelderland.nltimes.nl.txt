Veiligheidsregio Noord- en Oost-Gelderland was infected by ransomware over the weekend. Some functionality is limited or not working at all. The notification systems like P2000 and C2000, with which the security services communicate, are unaffected. "Safety is not at stake," the VNOG said, NOS reports. Ransomware is a type of malware that blocks access to your files. The VNOG noticed the ransomware infection on Saturday. The police and the security region are investigating whether the attackers gained access to sensitive data, and what the consequences are.
