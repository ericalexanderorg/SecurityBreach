At RedHunt Labs we decided to do an internet-scale study on the security posture of databases exposed on the internet. Despite the efforts of the MongoDB team coming up with security best practices, a major portion of the databases is still lying unauthenticated, open to the internet. In our research, we found 3,340 databases exposed to the internet without any authentication. During our research, we found 570 such exposed databases left open to the internet. We noticed that all the vulnerable databases also included an unauthenticated HTTP WebUI over port 50,070 exposed to the internet. From the statistics above, we can see that a major share of the databases on the internet remains prone to attacks. If you want to track your organization's databases which should never be exposed publicly on the internet, our SaaS-based offering NVADR can help in strengthening your organization's external security continuously.
