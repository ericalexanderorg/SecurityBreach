Cloud-based customer service company Zendesk notified customers that account information for 10,000 users was accessed prior to November 2016. Zendesk Support is the company's customer support ticketing service. Maarten Van Horenbeeck, chief information security officer of Zendesk said in a statement Wednesday the company became aware of the accessed data on September 24 when a third party notified them of the leak. The company said for that smaller subset of 700 customers, the unknown third parties accessed Transport Layer Security encryption keys provided to Zendesk by customers along with configuration settings of apps installed from the Zendesk app marketplace or private customer apps. The rotation of credentials will impact a larger group of customers and products that share authentication with the Zendesk Support service. Access of Zendesk data by a third party may also have implications under the General Data Protection Regulation. "Zendesk's customers are the Data Controllers of Service Data, and Zendesk is a Data Processor of that Service Data when it is performing the Zendesk Service. This means that it is up to each customer to determine if it is required under Article 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 to notify its Supervisory Authority, depending on whether the relevant risk thresholds have been met under the GDPR," according to Zendesk.
