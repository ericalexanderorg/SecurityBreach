The Ritz Hotel in London has launched an investigation into a data breach in which scammers may have posed as staff members to steal credit card data. In a series of messages posted to Twitter dated August 15, the luxury hotel chain said that on August 12, the company was made aware of a "Potential data breach within our food and beverage reservation system." Ritz London added that this may have led to the compromise of "Some of our clients' personal data." While the hotel said that the security incident did not include any credit card details or payment information, the leaked data may have been used in a social engineering scam designed to steal more valuable financial information - straight from the source. As reported by the BBC, scammers have phoned Ritz restaurant reservation holders with the "Exact" details of their bookings, while requesting the confirmation of their payment card details. One guest speaking to the publication said a scammer called her a day before she was due to visit the Ritz for afternoon tea. The Ritz hotel has emailed customers, emphasizing that staff will not call them after a reservation is made.
