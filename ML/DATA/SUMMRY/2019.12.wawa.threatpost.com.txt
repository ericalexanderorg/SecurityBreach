A recent dump of payment card information being sold on a popular online fraud marketplace suggests that more than 30 million payment cards may have been affected by a malware attack and data breach at Wawa convenience stores and gas stations that was first revealed in December. The marketplace boasted that the collection would include 30 million U.S. records across more than 40 states, as well as more than 1 million international records from more than 100 different countries, researchers wrote. While Wawa has the most locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the highest exposure of cards on Joker's Stash currently comes from Wawa locations in Florida, followed by Pennsylvania, according to Gemini. Overall, the Joker's Stash collection suggests that the Wawa breach has the dubious honor of being among some of the largest payment-card breaches of all time, joining other, more widely known retail companies, according to Gemini researchers. "It is comparable to Home Depot's 2014 breach exposing 50 million customers' data or to Target's 2013 breach exposing 40 million sets of payment card data," Alforov and Thomas wrote. Home Depot lost $43 million in investigation and recovery costs, and eventually agreed to pay $19.5 million in compensation for the more than 50 million cardholders affected by its 2014 breach. In a spot of good news for Wawa customers who may have been affected by the December breach, payment-card dumps like the one found on Joker's Stash are not in very high demand in the dark web world, Alforov and Thomas noted.
