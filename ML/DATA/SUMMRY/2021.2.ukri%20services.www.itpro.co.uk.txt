At least two government services have been knocked offline as part of a wider cyber attack against UK Research and Innovation, with hackers also encrypting data belonging to the public sector organisation. The cyber attack that UKRI has sustained has affected a number of its web assets. Some data is encrypted, and the nature of the attack is believed to be ransomware. Services affected include a portal of the UK Research Office, which offers information services to subscribers from its base in Brussels, and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council extranet. With some data encrypted, UKRI has assured the individuals affected that they will be contacted as soon as possible. The precise nature of the compromised data is still unknown and subject to the findings of an ongoing investigation, although this could include the loss of personal data, financial data and other sensitive data. "Suspending services may sound extreme, but organisations are often far better positioned to deal with the consequences of a cyber attack while offline, as they can fully inspect the damage and mitigate further upheaval. With greater risk, if sensitive data is released, it is far safer to suspend services that have been compromised until thorough checks have been made and more robust protection is in place."
