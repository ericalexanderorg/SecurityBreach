A database containing the personal details of 56.25 million US residents that allegedly belongs to the CheckPeople.com website was exposed online on a server having a Chinese IP address. The huge trove of data includes names, home addresses, phone numbers, and ages. The data are likely collected by the service from public sources. The strange aspect of this discovery is that the archive is exposed on an IP address operated by an Alibaba's web hosting company in Hangzhou, China. The archive did not contain criminal record searches, even if this kind of information is provided by the CheckPeople service. It is not clear if CheckPeople hosted its server in China or someone has obtained its data and exposed online, the unique certainly is that data belonging to 56.5 million American residents are now available for the Chinese Government and crooks.
