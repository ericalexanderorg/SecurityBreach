Technology giant Microsoft has apologised after thousands of people across the UK reported issues with its products, ranging from email service Outlook to the hit game Minecraft. The incident comes less than two weeks after a major global IT outage left over eight million computers using Microsoft systems inaccessible, impacting healthcare and travel, after a flawed software update by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Microsoft said it was "Investigating reports of issues connecting to Microsoft services globally". It comes hours before Microsoft is set to announce its latest financial reports at 2230 BST. An alert on the technology giant's service status website on Tuesday said it was looking into a "Network infrastructure" issue that was impacting access to Microsoft Azure - the cloud computing platform behind many of its services. "It seems slightly surreal that we're experiencing another serious outage of online services from Microsoft," said computer security expert Professor Alan Woodward. The outage appears to have also impacted other services which rely on Microsoft's platforms, with Cambridge Water among those affected. "Due to worldwide issues with Microsoft Azure, a problem with our website is affecting several services including MyAccount and PayNow," it said in a post on X.
