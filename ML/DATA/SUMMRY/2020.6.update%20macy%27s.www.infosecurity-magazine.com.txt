US department store giant Macy's has agreed to pay almost $200,000 to settle a lawsuit brought over a data breach, according to Footwear News. In the suit, plaintiff Anna Carroll accused the 162-year-old company of failing to properly secure customer data against cyber-attackers. On June 5, Macy's received final approval from a federal judge in Alabama to settle the suit. Class members will be reimbursed up to $1,500 provided they can supply documents to prove that they incurred expenses and lost time as a direct result of the data breach. Opting to pay to make the suit go away is not an admission of failure to implement adequate cybersecurity measures on Macy's part. In November 2019, Macy's notified its customers of a further data breach that occurred in October 2019. A Massachusetts consumer subsequently filed a class-action against Macy's in March 2020 over the 2019 data breach.
