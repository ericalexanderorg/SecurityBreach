A server misconfiguration has resulted in data pertaining to thousands of Razer customers being exposed to the Internet. A Singaporean-American manufacturer of gaming hardware, software, and systems, Razer also provides e-sports and financial services to its customers. The recently discovered misconfigured server, security researcher Bob Diachenko explains, contained order and shipping details for thousands of Razer's customers. Exposed customer information includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, internal customer IDs, order numbers and details, and billing and shipping addresses. Tens of thousands of Razer customers might have been affected. Although the security researcher attempted to notify Razer through their support channel, it took three weeks before the exposure was finally addressed. SecurityWeek has reached out to Razer via email to inquire about the company's official stance on the incident, but hasn't heard back by the time of publishing.
