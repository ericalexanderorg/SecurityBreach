A ransomware attack hitting Las Cruces Public Schools forced the district to shut down the entire computer system to contain the infection. The district activated the crisis response team and is working to restore critical services. Communication with schools in the district is done via phones and handheld radio stations. Recovering from a ransomware attack can take significant time even when caught early. Gadsden Independent School District is still recovering from a Ryuk ransomware attack in mid-July, working on rebuilding the email system and retrieving archived emails. Ransomware attacks were rampant this year, making victims among government, education, and healthcare entities like never before. A similar report from cybersecurity company Armor notes that since January 2019 there were 54 ransomware attacks disclosed publicly by educational institutions.
