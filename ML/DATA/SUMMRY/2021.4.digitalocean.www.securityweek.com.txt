Cloud solutions provider DigitalOcean has started informing some customers that their billing information may have been compromised after someone exploited a vulnerability in the company's systems. In an email sent to customers, DigitalOcean said the unauthorized access occurred between April 9 and April 22, 2021, but it was apparently only "Confirmed" on April 26. "An unauthorized user gained access to some of your billing account details through a flaw that has been fixed," the company told customers. DigitalOcean said only a "Small percentage" of its customers were impacted and they do not need to take any action. The exposed billing information includes name, address, payment card expiration date, the payment card's last four digits, and the name of the bank that issued the card. The company highlighted that it does not store full credit card data so this type of information was not exposed. "According to our logs approximately 1% of billing profiles were impacted," Tyler Healy, VP of security at DigitalOcean, told SecurityWeek in an emailed statement.
