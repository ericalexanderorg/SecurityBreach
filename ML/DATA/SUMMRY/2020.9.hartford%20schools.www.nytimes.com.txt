The scheduled first day of the school year, the district found itself paralyzed by a virus entirely different than the one they had been expecting: a ransomware attack that forced Hartford to postpone opening its public schools. As city employees continued to restore systems that were compromised in the attack, it was not clear when Hartford's public schools would be able to start their new academic year, officials said. After a number of locales in Connecticut fell victim to the crime last year - including the school district in Wolcott, Conn., which was hit twice in four months - the statewide school boards association urged districts to boost their cybersecurity protections. Hartford, where the school district shares technology resources with the city government, spent about $500,000 upgrading its security system last year, Mr. Bronin said on Tuesday. Hartford officials first learned of the ransomware attack on Saturday, when they discovered that more than 200 of the city's servers, including some used by the school system, the police department and 911 dispatchers, had been compromised. Among the impacted systems were the school district's student information system, which has personal data, academic records and schedules, and a transportation system that provides details about school bus routes. Dr. Torres-Rodriguez, the Hartford schools superintendent, said that the student information system had been fully restored by midnight on Tuesday, after a seven-hour rebooting process.
