Eskenazi Health went on diversion, meaning all incoming ambulances were routed to other hospitals, after an attempted ransomware attack early Wednesday morning. The attack occurred around 3:30 a.m., and the diversion began at 7:51 a.m. Wednesday. The move affected all of the health system's locations, including Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital downtown. The hospital shut down the network out of "An abundance of caution and to maintain the safety and integrity of our patient care," Tom Surber, media relations coordinator for Eskenazi Health, said in an emailed statement. He said the shutdown and subsequent diversion is not affecting patients who are currently receiving care at Eskenazi. The shutdown applied to systems within Eskenazi, such as email and electronic medical records, Surber said. Hospital systems will be checked "System by system with a high level of due diligence" before going back online, Surber said.
