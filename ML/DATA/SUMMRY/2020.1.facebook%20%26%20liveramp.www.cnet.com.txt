In LiveRamp's case, the hackers didn't need to target multiple accounts, they just needed one to gain access to the marketing giant's customers on Facebook. LiveRamp is a major data partner for Facebook, and a marketing powerhouse that pioneered data onboarding, which is matching data from your real-world actions to your online identity for advertisers. Facebook is one of LiveRamp's many data partners and helps advertisers target ads on the social network based on data gathered from offline activities. LiveRamp is also listed as a data partner on the Facebook for Business page, where advertisers can give LiveRamp special access to help on-board offline data and provide insight on ad campaigns. Hackers took advantage of that privilege in October, after hijacking the personal Facebook account of a LiveRamp employee who was an admin for the company's Business Manager account. Facebook offers a plethora of security tools to help protect your account from hackers, such as two-factor authentication and login alerts, so you know when someone has accessed your account without permission. Until the tech giant does, Kleczynski said, cybercriminals would have every incentive to go after personal Facebook accounts belonging to employees of the social network's data partners.
