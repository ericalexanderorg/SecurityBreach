Freepik Company, the organization behind the Freepik and Flaticon websites, has disclosed a data breach that impacted approximately 8.3 million of their users. On Flaticon, users can find over 3 million vector icons in various file formats. "[I]n our forensic analysis, we determined that an attacker extracted the email and, when available, the hash of the password of the oldest 8.3M users. The company reveals that for 4.5 million of the affected users no hashed password was leaked, because federated logins were used, exclusively. 3.55 million of these passwords were hashed using bcrypt, while for the remaining 229,000 salted MD5 was used. "Users who got their password hashed with bcrypt received an email suggesting them to change their password, especially if it was an easy to guess password. Users who only had their email leaked were notified, but no special action is required from them," the company announced. Freepik also added that it is regularly scanning the passwords and emails that have been leaked on the Internet to identify those that match credentials of Freepik and Flaticon users, and that it disables any passwords found to have been leaked, while also notifying the affected users.
