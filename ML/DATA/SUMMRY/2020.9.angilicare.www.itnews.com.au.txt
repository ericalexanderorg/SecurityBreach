Anglicare Sydney has revealed 17GB of its data was transmitted "To a remote location" after a ransomware attack but claims "There is no current evidence that data has been stolen". The retirement and aged care provider said that it was subject to a "Malicious cyber attack" on August 31, which took out its systems. While it said that "At this stage, there is no current evidence that data has been stolen", it went on to say that it had "Identified 17GB of data transmission to a remote location and this forms part of the forensic investigation in progress." "It is therefore premature to speculate on the impact," Anglicare Sydney said. It "Would not entertain engaging with cyber criminals," the organisation added, a clear message that it would not pay a ransom despite what appears to be a significant data exfiltration event. Anglicare Sydney said its compromise was "Part of increased illegal cyber activity targeting the Australian health and aged care sectors alongside other sectors seeking to obtain funds via ransomware activity." Around the same time, ASX-listed aged care provider Regis Healthcare also lost data to an overseas-based attacker that started leaking it.
