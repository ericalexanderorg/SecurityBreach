Multiple Python developers, including a maintainer of Top.gg, were infected with information-stealing malware after downloading a malicious clone of a highly popular tool, Checkmarx reports. To mount their supply chain attack, the hackers cloned the tool, inserted malicious code into it, and placed the malicious version on a fake mirror domain that relied on typosquatting to trick developers into mistaking it for the legitimate 'files. To spread the malware-laden package, the attackers created malicious repositories under their own accounts and hijacked high-profile accounts, including the GitHub account 'editor-syntax', a maintainer of the Top.gg search and discovery platform for Discord, which has a community of over 170,000 members. Using the 'editor-syntax' account, the attackers contributed a malicious commit to the top-gg/python-sdk repository, adding instructions to download the malicious clone of Colorama, and starred malicious GitHub repositories to increase their visibility. The account was likely hacked via stolen cookies, which the attackers used to bypass authentication and perform malicious activities without knowing the account's password. "By manipulating the package installation process and exploiting the trust users place in the Python package ecosystem, the attacker ensured that the malicious 'colorama' package would be installed whenever the malicious dependency was specified in the project's requirements," Checkmarx notes. Once the malicious code was executed, the infection process continued with several additional steps, such as downloading and executing additional Python code, fetching necessary libraries, and setting up persistence.
