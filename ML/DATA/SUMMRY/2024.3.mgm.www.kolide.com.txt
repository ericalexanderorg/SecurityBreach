Cybersecurity journalists immediately started predicting that the MGM hack would be spoken of in the same breath as the disastrous Uber and Marriott data breaches before it. When we look past the sequins and neon, we see that the MGM hack isn't unique; in fact, it sits at the nexus of several emerging trends. The MGM attack has commonly been attributed to the hacker groups Scattered Spider and ALPHV. To complicate things further, it's not clear if the two groups collaborated on this hack, if Scattered Spider merely used ALPHV's ransomware, or if one group attacked MGM while the other hacked Caesars. The MGM attack began when social engineers called MGM's help desk. The threat actors known as "Scattered Spider" have been widely blamed for the MGM hack. A lot of observers have laid the blame for the MGM hack on poor identity verification methods. The conversation around the MGM hack is part of a long tradition of security pros focusing on user identity and missing another crucial angle: the user's device.
