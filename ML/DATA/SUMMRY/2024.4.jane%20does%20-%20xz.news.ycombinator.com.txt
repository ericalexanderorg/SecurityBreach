" character to a piece of C code that was part of a check for sandboxing support, which I guess would cause the code to fail to compile, causing the check to fail, causing the sandboxing to be disabled. The hansjans162 Github account was created in 2023 and the only thing it did was add this code to liblzma. 1) Are there no legit code reviews from contributors like this? How did this get accepted into main repos while flying under the radar? When I do a code review, I try to understand the actual code I'm reviewing. You can copy that number into any password manager or plain file or whatever you want just like a password, and then use it to set up the same totp on 20 different apps on 20 different devices, all working at the same time, all generating valid totp codes at the same time, destroy them all, buy a new phone, retrieve any one of your backup keepass files or printouts, and enter them into a fresh app on a fresh phone and get all your totp fully working again. Aside from saving the actual seed, let's say you don't have the original qr code any more there is yet another emergency recovery which is the 10 or 12 recovery passwords that every site gives you when you first set up totp. You just burn one of your 12 single-use emergency codes, log in, disable and re-enable totp on that site, get a new qr code and a new set of emergency codes. If you can preserve a copy of the emergency codes, then you can just as easily preserve a copy of the seed value itself exactly the same way, and then, what's the point of a hanful of single-use emergency passwords when you can just have your normal fully functional totp seed?
