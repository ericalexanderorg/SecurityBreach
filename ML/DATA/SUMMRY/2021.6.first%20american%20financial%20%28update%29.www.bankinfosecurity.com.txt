First American Financial Corp., a Santa Clara, California-based company that's one of the largest providers of title insurance and settlement services, will pay the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a $488,000 penalty as a result of a data breach revealed two years ago. Computer security blogger Brian Krebs reported the breach to First American Financial after he was notified by a source in the real estate industry. First American Financial has said it "Strongly disagrees" with the charges. First American Financial did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the settlement. On Jan. 11, 2019, First American Financial's information security team finalized a report describing how during a manual penetration test, tit found that a user could increment the digits in a URL and see other documents in the system, according to the SEC. Also, some document images had been cached on publicly available search engines. If a vulnerability can't be fixed in the normal timeline, First American Financial's VRM calls for the EaglePro accountable remediation owner and management to obtain either a waiver or risk-acceptance approval from the CISO, the SEC says. As a result, a press release about the breach issued on May 24, 2019, and a Form 8-K filed with the SEC were created without full knowledge of the situation, the SEC writes.
