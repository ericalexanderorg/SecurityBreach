The massive breach of privacy of Verkada's customers highlights that companies - often, startups - have not always adopted best practices for privileged access to systems. "A leak of that secret means that anybody can now access any of those devices. And we, the industry, concluded long ago that is not a good approach to security." The video service will create a better approach to logging access to customers' data, has prioritized the hiring of security engineers, and has contracted with third-party security consultants to conduct a review, CEO Filip Kaliszan said in the statement. While many vendors retain some level of access to devices and services, suppliers should review what privileges are necessary to maintain their products and services and clearly communicate that to customers, says ExtraHop's Costlow. While a managed service provider is explicitly given access to devices, most businesses do not expect vendors to have the same level of access. "Once you have access to one [credential], you've got access to everything - that is an anti-pattern. That is not the way that it should be designed." Cloudflare, for example, said in its post that the breach only accessed the video cameras and that the company's implementation of a zero- trust architecture limited any breach.
