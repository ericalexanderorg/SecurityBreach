In late February 2024, after receiving a few support requests, the OWASP Foundation became aware of a misconfiguration of OWASP's old Wiki web server, leading to a data breach involving decade+-old member resumes. Who is affected? If you were an OWASP member from 2006 to around 2014 and provided your resume as part of joining OWASP, we advise assuming your resume was part of this breach. Why was the data collected? OWASP collected resumes as part of the early membership process, whereby members were required in the 2006 to 2014 era to show a connection to the OWASP community. What steps has OWASP taken to rectify the breach? We have disabled directory browsing, reviewed the web server and Media Wiki configuration for other security issues, removed the resumes from the wiki site altogether, and purged the CloudFlare cache to prevent further access. As many of the individuals affected by this breach are no longer with OWASP and the age of the data is between ten and 18 years old, a great deal of the personal details included in this breach are significantly out of date, making contact difficult. How does OWASP protect current membership data? We apply modern cloud-based security best practices such as two-factor authentication, minimal access, and resiliency to protect our membership data. We also purposefully collect only minimal information for OWASP membership to minimize any potential data loss in the future.
