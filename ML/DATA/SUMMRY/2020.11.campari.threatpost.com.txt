Italian spirits brand Campari has restored its company website following a recent ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks have been on the rise since the beginning of the pandemic last spring. Last July, SonicWall's 2020 Cyber Threat Report said ransomware attacks have more than doubled over last year. "As we've seen with Campari and many others, ransomware continues to be a significant threat to organizations large and small," Wade Lance, CTO at Illusive Networks said via email. "Cybercriminals only need to get lucky once when they attack with ransomware to be successful. On the other hand, large organizations must stop every attempted cyberattack aimed at them, and if they are wrong even once the consequences are catastrophic."
