The popular adult live streaming website CAM4 exposed over 7TB of personally identifiable information of members and users. The popular adult live streaming website CAM4 exposed over 10.88 billion database records containing a total of 7TB of personally identifiable information of its members and users. "Our security research team, led by Anurag Sen, has discovered a significant data leak stretching into billions of records at adult live-streaming website CAM4.com, belonging to Irish company Granity Entertainment." continues the report. "The server's database size exceeded 7 terabytes with production logs dating from 16 March 2020 and increasing daily. The unsecured Elastic Search database included a significant amount of both user and company information with the vast majority of email data records referring to users in the US.". Exposed records included a huge trove of information, including names, sexual orientation, emails to IP addresses, email message transcripts, and private conversations between users. Most of the exposed records belong to users from US, Brazil, Italy, and France. "US, Brazilian and Italian users were the most heavily affected although the precise number of email records is difficult to gauge accurately due to multiple entries being duplicated. As expected, countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Iran all had zero entries given the fact that these countries ban adult content domestically." continues the report.
