Naikon, a Chinese APT group that disappeared after its activities were disclosed in 2015, has been rediscovered and may have remained active but unrecognized since the 2015 reports. Researchers have uncovered evidence of a five-year stealth campaign against similar targets in the same geographical area that they believe to be conducted by Naikon. Naikon appears to be a little known but persistent Chinese APT group. Five years later, another five-year campaign has been exposed - implying that Naikon has been quietly operational for at least the last ten years. "While the Naikon APT group has kept under the radar for the past 5 years," concludes Check Point Research, "It appears that they have not been idle. In fact, quite the opposite. By utilizing new server infrastructure, ever-changing loader variants, in-memory fileless loading, as well as a new backdoor - the Naikon APT group was able to prevent analysts from tracing their activity back to them." Finkelsteen adds, "What drives them is their desire to gather intelligence and spy on countries, and they have spent the past five years quietly developing their skills and introducing a new cyber-weapon with the Aria-body backdoor. To evade detection, they were using exploits attributed to lots of APT groups, and uniquely using their victims' servers as command and control centers." Having been found again, it will be interesting to see whether Naikon again disappears, to reemerge at some point in the future with a new attack methodology using new tools against the same APAC governments.
