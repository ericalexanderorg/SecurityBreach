On February 8, 2021, a hacker successfully compromised all the servers we use to operate our business including the No Support Linux Hosting web site, Admin section, and our customer database. We can no longer operate the No Support Linux Hosting business. All customers should immediately download backups of their websites and databases through cPanel. Thank you to all our customers for the many years of business.
