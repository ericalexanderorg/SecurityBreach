Much of the compromise was facilitated by the group's establishment of multiple access vectors into the network, the network having a flat structure, and the use of insecure internally developed software that could be manipulated to perform arbitrary file upload. Exfiltrated data included privileged authentication credentials that enabled the group to log in, as well as network information that would allow an actor to regain unauthorised access if the original access vector was blocked. Compromised credentials were used to query the Active Directory and exfiltrate data by mounting file shares from multiple machines within the DMZ. The actor carried out a Kerberoasting attack in order to obtain valid network credentials from a server. A second IP, likely employed by the same actor, also begins posting to the same URL. The actor created and tested a number of likely web shells. Exploiting internet-exposed custom web applications provided an initial point of access for the actor The actor was later able to use credentials they had compromised to further their access to the network. The ASD's ACSC assesses that the actor may have collected these technical artefacts to hijack or create a remote login session as a legitimate user, and access the organisation's internal corporate network using a legitimate user account. The ASD's ACSC assesses that the actor would have sought to further the compromise of the organisation network. All hosts, HOST1, HOST2 and HOST3, were compromised by a malicious actor or actors, and web shells were placed on the hosts.
