The Taiwanese memory and storage chip maker ADATA was hit by the Ragnar Locker ransomware gang that also published more than 700GB of stolen data. The Ragnar Locker ransomware gang has published on its leak sites more than 700GB of data stolen from Taiwanese memory and storage chip maker ADATA. The group published the link to 13 password-protected archives, allegedly containing sensitive data stolen from the chipmaker. This is the second collection of archives allegedly stolen from ADATA that the ransomware operators leaked online, the first one, composed of 4 small 7-zip archives, was published on the leak site early this month in an attempt to make pressure on the victims and convince them into paying the ransom. Ragnar Locker ransomware gang initially published the archive on the popular MEGA storage service, but the platform closed their account and blocked access to the archives shared by the group. Ragnar Locker ransomware operators published the data after the chipmaker refused to pay the ransom. In November, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a flash alert to warn private industry partners of an increase of the Ragnar Locker ransomware activity following a confirmed attack from April 2020.
