Security researchers who acquired the stolen data warned Virgin Mobile KSA, which secured its network Friday, according to a source with knowledge of the attack. The attack against Virgin Mobile KSA is just one of a number of cybersecurity incidents to have affected organizations in the Middle East over the past few weeks. With Virgin Mobile KSA, it's possible the attackers are trying to make some money on the side after they've accomplished their primary goal, says Gene Yoo, CEO of Resecurity, a Los Angeles-based threat intelligence company. The source with knowledge of the Virgin Mobile KSA attacks says the attackers weren't asking for a specific price for the data but rather testing the waters to see how much someone might pay for it. One Australian security expert, who asked not to be identified, reviewed a list of IP addresses linked to the attack against Virgin Mobile KSA and said one IP address has previously been linked with activity attributed to the hacking group APT35, also known as "Cobalt Gypsy" or "Charming Kitten." Security experts suspect that group is linked with Iran but caution that online attacks cannot and should not be attributed based on a single IP address, not least when it comes to apparent Iranian hacking campaigns. The source with knowledge of the Virgin Mobile attack notes that many recent attacks have targeted CVE-2020-0688, a serious vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange, for which a patch was released on Feb. 11. In the Virgin Mobile KSA attack, after hackers were inside the network, they compromised an Active Directory domain controller, the source says.
