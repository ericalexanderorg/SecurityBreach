BUFFALO, N.Y. - As the investigation continues into last Friday's cybersecurity attack, parents of students in Buffalo Public Schools are left wondering how this happened. That when is now for Buffalo Public Schools as local, state, and federal law enforcement investigate a cybersecurity attack that shocked the district. "Did they get any information, any social security numbers, phone numbers, addresses? Buffalo Public Schools has all of that information. I think that's the main thing that I'm concerned about. I want my kids back in school but I also want everything to be safe," said Jasmine Hardy, a BPS parent. Hardy has two children in Buffalo Public Schools and says her 6-year-old son was supposed to return to in-person learning Monday. "His first time back in school in a whole year, my son has not been to school since last year and it's been killing us, both of them. It's hard on everybody, really bad. I'm just hoping they can get this fixed," she said. Hardy tells Spectrum News remote learning has been tough on her children and she's frustrated the attack could prolong remote learning for them. "Buffalo Public Schools dropped the ball," he said.
