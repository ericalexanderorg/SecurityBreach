Tens of thousands of scanned NSW driver's licenses and completed tolling notice statutory declarations were left exposed on an open Amazon Web Services storage instance, but Transport for NSW doesn't know how the sensitive personal data ended up in the cloud. The open AWS S3 bucket was found by Bob Diachenko of Security Discovery, as part of an investigation into another data breach. "All the documents I observed were related to the NSW area and there was no indication as to who might be the owner of the data," Diachenko told iTnews. A spokesperson for Transport for NSW said the agency is working with Cyber Security NSW to investigate what it called "The alleged data issue relating to an AWS S3 bucket containing personal information including driver licences." "Initial information indicates the exposed AWS S3 bucket is not related to Transport for NSW or any government system," the spokesperson said. "While it is always important for licence holders to be privacy aware when providing their sensitive personal information to other parties, Transport for NSW recognises that some third parties routinely request driver licence information as part of their business practices," the spokesperson said. "Transport for NSW's policies and procedures recognise the need for case-by-case consideration for customers believed to be impacted by identity fraud and where necessary issues new driver license/photo cards as appropriate." iTnews also sighted a NSW driver's licence, and a completed tolling notice statutory declaration form for a company, with details such as birth date and phone number of the person who had filled it in.
