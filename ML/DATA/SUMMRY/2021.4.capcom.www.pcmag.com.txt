Video game maker Capcom has uncovered how its servers became infected with ransomware in November-the hackers exploited an unsecured VPN device, enabling them to break in. According to Capcom, the hackers infiltrated its network by targeting an "Older backup VPN device" based in the company's North American subsidiary in California. Capcom was originally in the midst of phasing out the older VPN devices for a newer model. "One of the aforementioned older VPN devices remained solely at this North American subsidiary as an emergency backup in case of communication issues," the company said. Capcom didn't identify the VPN device's name or model. How the older VPN device was exploited was left unsaid. The hackers had managed to infiltrate Capcom's internal network in both the US and Japan through the VPN. The cybercriminals then stole company data and spread the Ragnar Locker ransomware strain, encrypting the affected servers in early November.
