Attackers have compromised a website collecting donations for the victims of the Australia bushfires and injected a malicious script that steals the payment information of the donors. This type of attack is called Magecart and involves hackers compromising a web site and injecting malicious JavaScript into eCommerce or checkout pages. These scripts will then steal any credit cards or payment information that is submitted and send it off to a remote site under the attacker's control. The Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team has discovered a legitimate web site collecting donations for the tragic bushfires in Australia that has been compromised by a Magecart script. As the code is still active on the site it could be modified by the hackers to utilize a new domain that will enable the skimming script again. Malwarebytes has contacted the site about the malicious script injected into their eCommerce store but has not heard back at this time. Using the PublicWWW tool, Troy Mursch of Bad Packets Report has also discovered that this same script is currently active on 39 other web sites.
