We consider it our responsibility to inform our affected users of the possibility of their contact details having been exposed, and at risk of a phishing attack. Based on the ongoing investigation of the incident and our communication with the third-party service provider there is a potential that the contact details of up to 66000 users, customers who have interacted with Trezor Support since December 2021, may have been accessed. The risk from the attack was mitigated entirely from a technical perspective on January 17th, 2024 at 20:20 CET. Our first contact with the third-party provider to estimate the scope of the unauthorized access happened on January 17th, 2024 at 20:26 CET. Initial reports from our third-party service provider indicated prompt attention to the issue, with assurances that no data exports or emails had occurred. If you receive any communication that asks for your seed phrase, it's likely a phishing attempt, and we ask that you contact our official support channel. If you received our notification email regarding the security issue, your contact details might have been among those exposed by the malicious actor at the third-party support ticketing portal we use. Based on the information we've received from our third-party service provider, we believe there is a potential that the contact details linked to up to 66,000 users in contact with our support since December 2021 could have been accessed. A small proportion of users are at risk of increased chances of phishing attempts, and as with all such attempts, we advise customers to stay vigilant and follow cyber security best practices.
