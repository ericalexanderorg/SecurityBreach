The website of popular photography and imaging retailer Focus Camera got hacked late last year by MageCart attackers to inject malicious code that stole customer payment card details. In true MageCart fashion, the script loaded at checkout to capture billing information and send it to the attacker's server. To hide the malicious traffic, the attackers registered "Zdsassets.com," a domain that resembles ZenDesk's legitimate "Zdassets.com." The MageCart domain was registered on November 11, 2019, with a hosting provider in the Netherlands and the thieving script was discovered in late December by Juniper employee Mounir Hahad. When analyzing the breach, Hahad found that the attacker modified a JavaScript file to inject an obfuscated payload. The routine is encoded using base64. The details it stole included email, customer name, address, phone number, and card details. According to DNS telemetry data seen by Hahad, the command and control domain receiving information belonging to Focus Camera customers was resolved 905 times since its creation. "It is possible the same C&C domain is being used across multiple compromised shopping sites and campaigns - At this time, we don't have any telemetry to prove it one way or the other" - Mounir Hahad. In a blog post today, Hahad says that the MageCart script acted when the customer made a purchase as a guest, without having registered.
