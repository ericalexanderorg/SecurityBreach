The United Nations headquarters in New York as well as the U.N.'s sprawling Palais des Nations compound in Geneva, its European headquarters, did not immediately respond to questions from the AP about the incident. The internal document from the U.N. Office of Information and Technology said 42 servers were "Compromised" and another 25 were deemed "Suspicious," nearly all at the sprawling United Nations offices in Geneva and Vienna. Technicians at the United Nations office in Geneva, the world body's European hub, on at least two occasions worked through weekends in recent months to isolate the local U.N. data center from the Internet, re-write passwords and ensure the systems were clean. The hack comes amid rising concerns about computer or mobile phone vulnerabilities, both for large organizations like governments and the U.N. as well as for individuals and businesses. Last week, U.N. human rights experts asked the U.S. government to investigate a suspected Saudi hack that may have siphoned data from the personal smartphone of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, in 2018. Dozens of independent human rights experts who work with the U.N. human rights office have greater leeway - and fewer political and financial ties to the governments that fund the United Nations and make up its membership - to denounce alleged rights abuses. The U.N. document highlights a vulnerability in the software program Microsoft Sharepoint, which could have been used for the hack.
