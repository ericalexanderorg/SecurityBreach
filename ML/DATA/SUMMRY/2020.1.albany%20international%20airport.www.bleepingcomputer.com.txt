Albany International Airport's staff announced that the New York airport's administrative servers were hit by Sodinokibi Ransomware following a cyberattack that took place over Christmas. Airport operations were not impacted by the ransomware attack and customers' financial or personal information was not accessed by the attackers according to a statement from airport officials per WNYT-TV. No airline or TSA servers were affected in the incident, with airport officials saying that the vast majority of encrypted files being administrative documents and archived data. The Albany County Airport Authority alerted the FBI and the New York State Cyber Command as soon as the attack was discovered, and also hired the services of ABS Solutions to help with the investigation. The attackers were able to infiltrate the New York airport's systems through the maintenance server of its managed service provider Logical Net, a Schenectady, NY-based data center services and hosted cloud solutions provider. The Sodinokibi Ransomware malware spread through the Albany County Airport Authority's network and also reached the backup servers. The airport paid the "Under six figures" ransom the attackers demanded. "Thanks to the fast action by our IT department, airport operations during one of the busiest travel periods of the year were not impacted and no passenger or airline data was acquired or accessed," Calderone added.
