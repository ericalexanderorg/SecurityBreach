Financially-motivated hackers believed to be operating out of Russia recently targeted companies in Western Europe, and the attacks apparently involved a combination of two Windows vulnerabilities that Microsoft did not expect to be exploited. According to Singapore-based cybersecurity firm Group-IB, the threat groups tracked as TA505 and Silence - the company previously found links between the two groups - targeted at least two pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies in Belgium and Germany in late January. The attacks have been attributed to Silence and TA505 based on the used tools, but it's possible that only one of them was involved. Group-IB researchers uncovered this exploit on the attacker' servers and they believe it was likely deployed in the campaign targeting European companies. Earlier this month, cybersecurity firm Prevailion published a report detailing attacks launched by TA505 against German companies. The attacks involved trojanized resumes sent to the human resources department at targeted businesses. If Silence was involved in the recent attacks on pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies, it could indicate a shift in their strategy, Group-IB said.
