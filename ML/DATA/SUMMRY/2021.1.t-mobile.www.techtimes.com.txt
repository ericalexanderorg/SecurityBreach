2020 ended with T-Mobile announcing its very second data breach of the entire year. It was then stated that the company already started the investigation into T-Mobile hacked 2021 along with the assistance from the United States' known leading cybersecurity forensics experts. The data is known as the customer proprietary network information or CPNI and this data can include the customers' call records. The company stated that hackers did not actually gain access to the customer names, home, or even their email addresses, account passwords, and financial data. A certain spokesperson for T-Mobile reportedly told BleepingComputer that the particular breach only affected about 0.2% of the total T-Mobile customers. Just about two months into last year, T-Mobile had publicly admitted in an article by ZDNet that the company had suffered yet another breach on its own email systems that saw certain hackers access a number of T-Mobile employee email accounts. It had also reportedly exposed some of T-Mobile's customer data as well.
