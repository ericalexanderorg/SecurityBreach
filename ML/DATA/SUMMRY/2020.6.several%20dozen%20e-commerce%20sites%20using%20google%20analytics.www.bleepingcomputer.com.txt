Hackers are using Google's servers and the Google Analytics platform to steal credit card information submitted by customers of online stores. A new method to bypass Content Security Policy using the Google Analytics API disclosed last week has already been deployed in ongoing Magecart attacks designed to scrape credit card data from several dozen e-commerce sites. This new tactic takes advantage of the fact that e-commerce web sites using Google's web analytics service for tracking visitors are whitelisting Google Analytics domains in their CSP configuration. New research from web security companies Sansec and PerimeterX shows that using CSP to prevent credit card skimming attacks is pointless on sites that also deploy Google Analytics as threat actors can use it to exfiltrate harvested data to their own accounts. Instead of blocking injection-based attacks, allowing Google Analytics scripts benefits attackers as they can utilize them to steal data. Sansec's Threat Research Team today disclosed that it was tracking a Magecart campaign since March 17, with the attackers abusing this exact issue to bypass CSP on several dozen e-commerce sites using Google Analytics. The attackers can then collect the stolen credit card data from their free Google Analytics dashboard and decrypt it using an XOR encryption key.
