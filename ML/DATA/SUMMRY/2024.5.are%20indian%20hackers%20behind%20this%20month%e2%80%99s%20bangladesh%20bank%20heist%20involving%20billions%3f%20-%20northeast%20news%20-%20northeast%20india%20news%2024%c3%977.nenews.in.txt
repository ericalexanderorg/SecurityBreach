Unidentified suspected Indian hackers allegedly took to digital means and ferreted out a few billion dollars from Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, about a week ago, at least three officials familiar with the heist revealed to the Northeast News. While the sources were chary to disclose the amount sucked out of Bangladesh Bank, they confirmed that Indian and Bangladesh authorities, including the security agencies of the two countries were aware of the "Sensational" heist and were "Quietly" probing the crime. For the past two weeks, Bangladesh Bank authorities have restricted the entry of journalists into the central bank's Motijheel headquarters. The bank filch, the biggest in Bangladesh's history, has sent shockwaves in the top echelons of the Bangladesh government, with very few senior central bank officials having direct knowledge of it. The level and depth of sophistication employed by the hackers involved compromising the bank's network and navigating the SWIFT1 "Gateway" to send 35 fraudulent fund transfer requests on behalf of the Bangladesh Bank. At that time, senior Bangladesh Bank executives and government officials had successfully kept the bank heist under wraps. While Bangladesh Bank authorities launched an internal investigation, preliminary findings at that time suggested that entries related to Taka 2,000 crore deposits in several commercial banks were prima facie erased from the database.
