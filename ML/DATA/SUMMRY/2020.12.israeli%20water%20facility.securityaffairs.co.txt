A group of Iranian hackers gained access to a un unprotected ICS at an Israeli Water Facility and posted a video as proof of the hack. Researchers from industrial cybersecurity firm OTORIO revealed that a group of Iranian hackers gained access to a un unprotected ICS at the Israeli Water Facility. The hackers claimed to have breached an Israeli water facility, likely recycled water, in a video that was published the night of December 1st, 2020. "The reservoir's HMI system was connected directly to the internet, without any security appliance defending it or limiting access to it. Furthermore, at the time of the publication, the system did not use any authentication method upon access." reads the blog post published by OTORIO. "This gave the attackers easy access to the system and the ability to modify any value in the system, allowing them, for example, to tamper with the water pressure, change the temperature and more. All the adversaries needed was a connection to the world-wide-web, and a web browser." This access could have allowed the attackers to interact with processes at the water facility by manipulating the value of parameters such as water pressure and temperature. In April an attack hit an Israeli water facility attempting to modify water chlorine levels. One of the attacks hit agricultural water pumps in upper Galilee, while the other one hit water pumps in the central province of Mateh Yehuda.
