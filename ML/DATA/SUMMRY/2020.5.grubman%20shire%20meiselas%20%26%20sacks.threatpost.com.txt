Cybercriminals used the REvil ransomware to attack a law firm used by the likes of Lady Gaga, Drake and Madonna. A popular law firm that works with several A-list celebrities, including Lady Gaga, Drake and Madonna, has been hit by a ransomware attack. According to researchers with Emsisoft, cybercriminals hit the law firm in a cyberattack using the REvil ransomware. Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks works with a client list of more than 200 high-profile celebrities, including Elton John, Rod Stewart, Lil Nas X, The Weeknd and U2. Companies like Facebook, Sony, HBO and iHeartMedia are also clients of the law firm. Attackers using the REvil ransomware created a "Happy Blog" this year, where they have recently published details of ransomware attacks on 13 targets, as well as company information stolen from the targeted organizations. The operators behind the Sodinokibi ransomware threatened to sell the entire database compromised from global currency exchange Travelex after a malware attack at the new year knocked the company offline and crippled its business during the month of January. "The overwhelming tendency is to focus on the ransomware itself in these types of cases, but ransomware doesn't magically appear on a system," Erlin said.
