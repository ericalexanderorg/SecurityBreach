Several French government bodies have been hit by cyberattacks of unprecedented intensity, according to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's office. The government announced the set up of a special crisis center to expedite the restoration of the affected services. The group apparently targeted the State Interministerial Network, which connects thousands of government websites. The French cybersecurity agency, ANSSI, stated it had implemented filtering measures to counter the cyberattack. The French government has accused Russia of running online misinformation campaigns against Western countries supporting Ukraine's war effort. The government of France has been pushing to better its cyber security infrastructure owing to numerous ransomware attacks since 2021, including an attack in 2023 on medical insurance companies that exposed the personal data of over 33 million people in the country. The incident raises further red flags over the growing involvement of nation-state bad actors and the number of cyberattacks that have plagued government entities worldwide in recent years.
