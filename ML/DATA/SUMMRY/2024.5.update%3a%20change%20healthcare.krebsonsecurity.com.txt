There are indications that U.S. healthcare giant Change Healthcare has made a $22 million extortion payment to the infamous BlackCat ransomware group as the company struggles to bring services back online amid a cyberattack that has disrupted prescription drug services nationwide for weeks. The cybercriminal who claims to have given BlackCat access to Change's network says the crime gang cheated them out of their share of the ransom, and that they still have the sensitive data Change reportedly paid the group to destroy. On March 3, a BlackCat affiliate posted a complaint to the exclusive Russian-language ransomware forum Ramp saying that Change Healthcare had paid a $22 million ransom for a decryption key, and to prevent four terabytes of stolen data from being published online. Assuming Change Healthcare did pay to keep their data from being published, that strategy seems to have gone awry: Notchy said the list of affected Change Healthcare partners they'd stolen sensitive data from included Medicare and a host of other major insurance and pharmacy networks. Instead of responding that they would compensate and placate Notchy, a representative for BlackCat said today the group was shutting down and that it had already found a buyer for its ransomware source code. Fabian Wosar, head of ransomware research at the security firm Emsisoft, said it appears BlackCat leaders are trying to pull an "Exit scam" on affiliates by withholding many ransomware payment commissions at once and shutting down the service. BlackCat's apparent demise comes closely on the heels of the implosion of another major ransomware group - LockBit, a ransomware gang estimated to have extorted over $120 million in payments from more than 2,000 victims worldwide.
