The REvil ransomware gang, also known as Sodinokibi, claims to have stolen 50 gigabytes of information from an Argentine government website. In his message, Darktrace shared a screenshot with the data that the ransomware group posted on their "Happy Blog." The files, supposedly hacked, are preceded by the following sentence: "You should contact us. If you do not do it within a week, we will publish everything we download about you". When consulted by local media, representatives of the Ministry of Innovation and Digital Transformation, administrators of that portal, denied having suffered any ransomware attack. This is how the National Cybersecurity Directorate, through the Emergency Coordination in Teleinformatics Networks, told the media that the images shown seemed to coincide with information stolen in a ransomware attack made to the domain of Roads at argentina. This hack joins other ransomware attacks that Argentine government agencies and companies have suffered in the course of 2020. As reported by CriptoNoticias, the website of the National Directorate of Migration was attacked in September with the Netwalker ransomware. The practice is part of a trend towards growth of ransomware around the world, particularly in Latin America.
