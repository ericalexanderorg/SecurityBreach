The South Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute has confirmed that an unknown third-party gained unauthorized access to its systems. In the cyberattack, which took place last month, the adversary exploited a vulnerability in a VPN system used within the research institute's environment, KAERI said Friday. "Currently, the Atomic Energy Research Institute is investigating the subject of the hacking and the amount of damage," the institute also said. South Korean news outlet Sisa Journal broke the news about the hack, but KAERI initially denied the claims. On Friday, the research institute apologized for that. The investigation into the KAERI cyberattack revealed the use of several IP addresses, including one that was previously associated with Kimsuky assaults, the research institute said at a press conference, The Record reports. The incident falls in line with Kimsuky activity that Malwarebytes detailed at the beginning of the month, which involved attacks against multiple South Korean entities, including the International Atomic Energy Agency Nuclear Security Officer.
