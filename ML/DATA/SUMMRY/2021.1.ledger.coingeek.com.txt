Today, Ledger disclosed that 20,000 new customer records were leaked and are now out in the wild. This is not the first time that Ledger understated the effects of a security breach. At the time, Ledger believed that only 9,500 customers had their email addresses, as well as their first and last name, postal address, phone number, and information regarding their ordered products stolen. How did Ledger find this out? Because the customer's personal identification information was published on RaidForums, a marketplace for buying, selling, and sharing hacked information. Since the original breach occurred and customer data was published on RaidForums, Ledger customers have been the victim of phishing attacks and have received threats from hackers via phone and email. The security breach has caused many people in the digital currency community to distrust Ledger. Given how easy it was for the data to be stolen and how irresponsible Ledger was when it came to addressing the breach and the damage it caused.
