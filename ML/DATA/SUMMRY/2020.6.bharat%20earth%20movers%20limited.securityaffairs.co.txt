Researchers from cyber threat intelligence firm Cyble reported that a threat actor is offering in a darkweb black-market documents of the Indian defence contractor Bharat Earth Movers Limited. According to the researchers, the data breach has occurred in May 2020 and the data was published on May 25. "As per our research team, the actor R3dr0x has targeted the part of the BEML website detailing about their Indigenisation Levels, which seem to be a warning for the extremist government of Indian that they would face in the near future for their actions." reads the post published by Cyble. The actor leaked sensitive files from 7 email accounts of BEML employee accounts along with a text file containing seven employee's internal email addresses and their login passwords. The leaked data includes multiple BEML's email conversations, customer's detailed records, multiple interoffice memos, freight invoices, and others documents. Experts speculate the data leak could be an act of a hacktivist or politically motivated attackers, but they have no technical evidence suggesting the involvement of a nation state actor.
