The web site for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY was hacked to include a malicious MageCart script that stole the payment information of customers who purchased items on the site. According to a notification filed with California's security breach notification service, the National Baseball Hall of Fame's web site had a malicious script injected into their online store between November 15, 2018 and May 14, 2019. "The National Baseball Hall of Fame values and respects the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information," the notification alerted affected users. "On June 18, 2019, we learned that some of your information could have been obtained by an unauthorized third-party that placed malicious computer code on the Hall of Fame web store e-commerce system. The code may have targeted certain personal information of customers who made a credit card purchase via the web store between November 15, 2018 and May 14, 2019.". If you purchased anything from the National Baseball Hall of Fame web site located at https://baseballhall.org/, you should report the situation to your credit card company and monitor your statement for fraudulent purchases. Attackers gained access to the Hall of Fame's web site and injected a malicious script on the site that would monitor for submitted payment information and then forward it to the attackers. While the script is no longer active on the web site, BleepingComputer was able to locate the code in a snapshot on Archive.org.
