Western Australian officials have launched an investigation after the office of Premier Mark McGowan was reportedly targeted in a cyber-attack linked to the Chinese military. The New York Times reports that in January, a member of the premier's staff received an email with a Word document attached seemingly from a known contact at Indonesia's embassy in Australia. The attachment contained an invisible cyber-attack tool with "Alarming new capabilities" which hackers could use to remotely take over a computer and copy, delete or create files, while also carrying out extensive searches of the device's data. The premier on Friday said the matter had been referred to the director-general of the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The New York Times report said the hacker was able to take over the computer used by an Indonesian diplomat in Canberra, complete a document the diplomat was working on, then send it to the McGowan government staffer. Opposition spokesman Zak Kirkup said the premier should reveal what measures had been put in place to protect sensitive information. "Potentially sensitive information could also be used as leverage against the premier, his staff and the state of Western Australia as a whole."
