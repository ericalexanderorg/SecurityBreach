Attorneys working with ClassAction.org are looking into whether a class action lawsuit can be filed in light of the CCM Health data breach. CCM Health has begun notifying patients that its network systems were breached between April 3 and April 10, 2023, resulting in the unauthorized access of their personal data. According to CCM Health's online notice of the cybersecurity incident, the compromised information may include names, addresses, dates of birth, driver's license or state ID numbers, passport numbers, Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, routing numbers, payment card numbers and health insurance information. The breach may have also exposed certain medical information, including medical record numbers, patient account numbers, prescription information, healthcare provider names, medical diagnoses, diagnosis codes, treatment types, treatment locations and dates, admission and discharge dates, and/or lab results. You may be able to start a class action lawsuit to recover compensation for loss of privacy, time spent dealing with the breach, out-of-pocket costs, and more. A successful case could also force CCM Health to ensure it takes proper steps to protect the information it was entrusted with.
