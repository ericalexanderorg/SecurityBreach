Netwalker ransomware operators breached the networks of Forsee Power, a well-known player in the electromobility market. A new company has been added to the list of the victims of the Netwalker ransomware operators, it is Forsee Power, which provides advanced lithium-ion battery systems for any mobility application. Recently Cyble threat research group came across another disclosure from the Netwalker group that announced to have stolen sensitive data from Forsee Power. Netwalker ransomware operators announced the attack with a message posted on their online blog and shared a few screenshots as proof of the security breach. The Netwalker ransomware operators have been very active since March and also took advantage of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak to target organizations. The threat actors initially leveraged phishing emails delivering a Visual Basic Scripting loader, but since April 2020, Netwalker ransomware operators began exploiting vulnerable Virtual Private Network appliances, user interface components in web apps, or weak passwords of Remote Desktop Protocol connections to gain access to their victims' networks. Recently the Netwalker ransomware operators were looking for new collaborators that can provide them with access to large enterprise networks.
