A threat actor has released the databases of Utah-based gun exchange and hunting sites for free on a cybercrime forum. On August 10th, a hacker has leaked online the databases of Utah-based gun exchange for free on a cybercrime forum. He claims the databases contain 195,000 user records for the utahgunexchange.com, 45,000 records for their video site, 15,000 records from the hunting site muleyfreak.com, and 24,000 user records from the Kratom site deepjunglekratom.com. The leaked data includes login names, hashed passwords, and email addresses. It is not confirmed that all of the leaked data is legitimate, anyway, experts suggest users change their password immediately. Using unique passwords prevents a data breach at one site from affecting you at other websites you use. To check if your information has been exposed in this and other data leaks, you can search for your email using the Cyble's "Am I Breached" data breach monitoring service.
