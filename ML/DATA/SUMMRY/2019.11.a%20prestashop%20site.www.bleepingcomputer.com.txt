A payment service platform's checkout page was recently cloned by the threat actors behind a web skimming campaign that harvested and stole credit card information from an online shop's customers. Web skimming is the process through which fraudsters can harvest and steal customers' payment or personally identifiable information after injecting malicious code in the form of payment card skimmer scripts within a compromised e-commerce site's payment processing platform. The e-skimming campaign observed by Malwarebytes Director of Threat Intelligence Jérôme Segura didn't bother with trying to scrape the info entered by buyers into the store's forms but went straight to the PSP, effectively replacing its checkout page with a cloned one to intercept and collect the shoppers' credit card data. The fake checkout page displayed by the skimmer is very similar to a phishing landing page since given that it is a cloned payment page template from CommWeb, a Commonwealth Bankpayments acceptance service. Like the text displayed on the payment info on the skimmer page states, the "Details will be sent to and processed by The Commonwealth Bank of Australia and will not be disclosed to the merchant," effectively making a phishing page designed specifically for harvesting and exfiltrating financial data to attacker-controlled servers. Web skimmer groups who used phishing to steal credit card data are not revolutionary as detailed by RiskIQ's head of threat research Yonathan Klijnsma in an analysis of Magecart Group 4's overlay payment phishing system from February 2019, with the crooks being observed while replacing online stores' legitimate payment forms with their own. As the company said, malicious credit card skimming scripts that stole their customers' payment info were injected in their store's checkout and the users' wallet page, and successfully harvested data for about a week between October 7 and October 15 when the hack was noticed.
