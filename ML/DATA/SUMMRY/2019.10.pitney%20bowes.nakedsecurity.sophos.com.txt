For what seems like the umpteenth time this year, a big company has found itself struggling after a ransomware attack. The victim this time is US mailing services company, Pitney Bowes, which made an announcement to explain why a range of its services had been disrupted. Currently, some of those services might be down, the company said, including SendPro products, postage refill, 'Your Account' access, and the 'Supplies' web store. We don't know which ransomware is involved, nor when the affected systems might return. In a separate ransomware incident, French media company Groupe M6 was hit by an attack at the weekend that took down servers and phone lines. Although the company appears to have suffered only mild disruption, at least one other company, TV station TF1, tweeted that it had stopped email communication with Groupe M6 for fear of the infection spreading. Only days before that, US company Alphabroder was hit by Sodinokibi, a derivative of the GandCrab ransomware.
