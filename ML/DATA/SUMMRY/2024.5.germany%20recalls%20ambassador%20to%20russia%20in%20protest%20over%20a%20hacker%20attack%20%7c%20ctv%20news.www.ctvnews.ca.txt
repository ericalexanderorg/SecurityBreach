Germany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged hacker attack on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party. Germany last week accused Russian military agents of hacking into the top echelons of Scholz's Social Democrats' party and other sensitive government and industrial targets. The Foreign Office in Berlin said Monday that the government is taking the latest incident "Seriously" and that Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock had decided to call back German Ambassador Alexander Lambsdorff. The German Interior Ministry said in a statement last week that the hacking campaign began as early as March 2022, a month after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with emails at the Social Democrat party headquarters accessed beginning that December. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense since Moscow's attack on Ukraine. "What Russia is doing and planning is not acceptable. Russia is ready to use any means possible to harm our societies." In Prague, the Czech Foreign Ministry summoned Russia's ambassador over the attacks by the same APT28 group linked to Russia's GRU military intelligence unit.
