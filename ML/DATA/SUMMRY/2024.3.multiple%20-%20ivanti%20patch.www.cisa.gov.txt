CISA has observed widespread and active exploitation of vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure solutions, hereafter referred to as "Affected products." Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in these affected products allows a malicious threat actor to move laterally, perform data exfiltration, and establish persistent system access, resulting in full compromise of target information systems. CVE-2023-46805 is a vulnerability found in the web component of Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure. CVE-2024-21887 is a command injection vulnerability in web components of Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure. Ivanti has released a temporary mitigation through an XML file that can be imported into affected products to make necessary configuration changes until the permanent update is available. To bring a compromised product back into service, reset the device with the affected Ivanti solution software to factory default settings and download and import "Mitigation.release.20240107.1.xml," via Ivanti's download portal, into the affected product. Apply updates that address the two vulnerabilities referenced in this Directive to the affected products as they become available and no later than 48 hours following their release by Ivanti. One week after the issuance of this Directive, report to CISA a complete inventory of all instances of Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure products on agency networks, including details on actions taken and results.
