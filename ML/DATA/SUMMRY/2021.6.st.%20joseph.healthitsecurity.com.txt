June 21, 2021 - St. Joseph's/Candler, a large hospital system in Savannah, Georgia, suffered a ransomware attack on June 17th, according to a report by local news station WSAV. The attack led to EHR downtime, and all documentation is being done on pen and paper until the attack is contained. Law enforcement is still actively investigating the ransomware attack, and it is unclear how long the hospital's systems will remain in downtime. In order to combat a string of ransomware attacks across multiple industries, President Biden recently issued an executive order outlining steps that must be taken to improve the country's cybersecurity. The new Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force aims to address threats to the growing number of ransomware attacks. The FDA recently voiced concerns over medical device cybersecurity in a paper responding to NIST's request for comments on President Biden's executive order, further conveying the government's intention to use its extensive resources to prevent additional ransomware attacks. "Publicly noted cybersecurity incidents in 2021 include ransomware disabling the Irish Healthcare Service, ransomware disrupting a hospital for weeks, and a fundamentally new problem where ransomware remediation disrupted the cloud services necessary for critical function of cancer radiation therapy rather than simply disrupting electronic health record systems and other, more traditional hospital IT infrastructure," the FDA emphasized. The National Institute of Standards and Technology released a preliminary draft of its "Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management." The draft provides organizations with a step-by-step approach to preventing and responding to ransomware attacks.
