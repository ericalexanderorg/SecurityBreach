Researchers further inspected the files containing the payload and discovered these impersonated JPG files showing NATO images when opened on a computer. The malicious file distributed by APT28 is titled, "Course 5 - 16 October 2020.zipx". Jpg," the ZIP archive behaves almost like a legitimate image file. The file metadata and properties also show an "Image/jpeg" MIME type with references to "JPEG image data." "This technique works because JPEG files are parsed from the beginning of the file and some Zip implementations parse Zip files from the end of the file without looking at the signature in the front," the researchers explain. On Windows systems, the "Course 5 - 16 October 2020.exe" file shows a PDF icon. By providing course materials in a ZIP file that has a deliberately corrupted XLS file may tempt the user into double-clicking what looks like a PDF-the EXE file.
