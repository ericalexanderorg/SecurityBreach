Since January, 1,039 schools across the U.S. have been potentially hit by a ransomware attack after 72 school districts and/or educational institutions have publicly reported being a ransomware victim according to a report from security solutions provider Armor. Since the firm previously reported in September that over 500 U.S. schools were hit by ransomware since January, the number of affected schools more than doubled in under three months according to Armor's stats. To understand the impact a ransomware attack can have when it hits a school district, just in the case of the Las Cruces Public Schools the incident led to the full shutdown of all roughly 30,000 district devices from 42 schools, as well as full hard drive wipes and operating system reinstalls. Healthcare orgs have reportedly been impacted by 44 ransomware attacks since the start of 2019, while Managed Service Providers and/or Cloud-Based Service Providers publicly reported 18 ransomware incidents. In a separate annual ransomware report published on December 12, Emsisoft says that the impacted educational organizations in 2019 included "86 universities, colleges and school districts, with operations at up to 1,224 individual schools potentially affected." They also state that 103 state and municipal governments and agencies have also reported ransomware incidents, while healthcare providers have been hit by ransomware gangs 759 times throughout 2019. In a breakdown by industry sectors, Emsisoft found that the healthcare sector was at the top of the list of most popular ransomware targets this year, with the roughly 759 healthcare providers that have been hit by such attacks during 2019.
