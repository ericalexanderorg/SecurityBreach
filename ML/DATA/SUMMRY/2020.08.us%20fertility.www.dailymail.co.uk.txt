US Fertility, which is one of the most expansive fertility clinic networks in the US, has revealed it was hit by a ransomware attack and the names, addresses and in some cases private health data and Social Security numbers of patients were taken. 'The forensic investigation is now concluded and confirmed that the unauthorized actor acquired a limited number of files during the period of unauthorized access which occurred between August 12 and September 14, when the ransomware was executed,' US Fertility said in a statement. Then some ransomware groups publish the stolen data on their websites if they are not paid the ransom, as per Tech Crunch. The company warned that the attack may have also involved protected health information, which can include information about a person's health, medical conditions, tests results or medical records. US Fertility was formed in May as a partnership between Shady Grove Fertility, which has dozens of locations across the East Coast of the US and Amulet Capital Partners, a private equity firm that invests in the healthcare space. It's not clear why US Fertility took months to disclose the attack. In 2017 a Minnesota fertility clinic was also hit by a ransomware attack that may have exposed some patients' personal information and health information.
