It's one of multiple components of a malware constellation being used in carefully orchestrated attacks that also feature rampant data collection. Snatch attacks Windows machines with a collection of malware that includes the ransomware executable; a custom-built data stealer; a Cobalt Strike reverse-shell; and several publicly available tools that are typically used by penetration testers, system administrators or technicians. From there, Snatch spread other executables, designed to give the attackers remote access without having to rely on the compromised Azure server, to 200 machines, or roughly 5 percent of the computers on the company's internal network. Snatch Team installed a free Windows utility called Advanced Port Scanner, using it to discover additional machines on the network that they could target. Finally, after surveillance and data collection, Snatch Team downloaded the ransomware to infected machines. Snatch has been seen in attacks in United States, Canada and several European countries, researchers found. In all cases, the ransomware portion of the attack came several days to weeks after the initial network breach.
