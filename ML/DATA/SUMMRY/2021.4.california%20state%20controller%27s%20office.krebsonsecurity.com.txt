A phishing attack last week gave attackers access to email and files at the California State Controller's Office, an agency responsible for handling more than $100 billion in public funds each year. The phishers had access for more than 24 hours, and sources tell KrebsOnSecurity the intruders used that time to steal Social Security numbers and sensitive files on thousands of state workers, and to send targeted phishing messages to at least 9,000 other workers and their contacts. "The SCO has reason to believe the compromised email account had personal identifying information contained in Unclaimed Property Holder Reports," the agency said, urging state employees contacted by the agency to place fraud alerts on their credit files with the major consumer bureaus. An always-reliable source in an adjacent California state agency who's been tracking the incident internally with other employees says the SCO forgot to mention the intruders also had access to the phished employee's Microsoft Office 365 files - and potentially any files shared with that account across the state network. The source said the intruders stole several documents with personal and financial data on thousands of state employees, and then used the phished employee's inbox to send targeted phishing emails to at least 9,000 California state workers and their contacts. Organizations hoping to improve internal security often turn to companies that help employees learn how to detect and dodge email phishing attacks - by sending them simulated phishing emails and then grading employees on their responses. Which suggests plenty of people who definitely should get phish tested along with everyone else won't get the same ongoing training.
