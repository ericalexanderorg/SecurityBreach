Cloud infrastructure provider DigitalOcean is informing customers that it inadvertently exposed some of their data to the Internet. Last week, the company started alerting customers that some of their data might have been accessed by third-parties after a document from 2018 was unintentionally made available via a public link. "This document contained your email address and/or account name as well as some data about your account that may have included Droplet count, bandwidth usage, some support or sales communications notes, and the amount you paid during 2018," a copy of the notification that was shared online reads. Responding to an email inquiry from SecurityWeek, the company said it feels "Confident there was no malicious access to that document," but that it decided to inform customers anyway, for transparency. DigitalOcean also revealed that less than 1% of its customer base was impacted by the incident, and that account name and email address represented the only personally identifiable information included in the exposed file. "This was not related to a malicious act to access our systems. Our customers trust us with their data and we believe that an unintended use of that data, no matter how small, is reason enough to be transparent," a company spokesperson said. Replying to a comment to the publicly shared emailed notification, a DigitalOcean employee revealed that customers receiving the alert could learn specific details on the amount of information that was exposed for them by replying to the notification itself.
