The University of Utah coughed up a $457,000 ransom payment after a ransomware attack hit the university's servers, impacting undisclosed student and faculty related data. The university sought to downplay the attack's impact, stressing that no central university IT systems were compromised, and that only.02 percent of the data on the compromised servers was affected by the attack. The university did say that it asked students, faculty and staff to change their university passwords after the attack. "The university notified appropriate law enforcement entities, and the university's Information Security Office investigated and resolved the incident in consultation with an external firm that specializes in responding to ransomware attacks," according to the University of Utah in a Thursday statement. "After careful consideration, the university decided to work with its cyber insurance provider to pay a fee to the ransomware attacker," it said. The University of Utah is the latest in a string of higher education institutions that have been hit by ransomware - and many have ended up paying the ransom. Threatpost has reached out to the University of Utah for further details, including what vulnerability was exploited, which ransomware was utilized in the attack, and whether they have received a working decryption key since paying the ransom.
