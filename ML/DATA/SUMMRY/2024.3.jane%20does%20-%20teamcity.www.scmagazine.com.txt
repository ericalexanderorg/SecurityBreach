A JetBrains TeamCity critical vulnerability is being actively exploited to create hundreds of administrator accounts on more than 1,400 servers. On Monday, JetBrains patched and disclosed a critical flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-27198, which enables authentication bypass to gain administrative control over TeamCity servers. The TeamCity vulnerability was discovered by Rapid7, which said in its disclosure published Monday that exploiting the bug would give an attacker "Full control over all TeamCity projects, builds, agents and artifacts," setting the stage for potential supply chain attacks. "We started hearing from some of our customers who were noticing their servers had been compromised shortly after Rapid7 made their full disclosure with exploit examples, and the subsequent exploit module," JetBrains TeamCity Solutions Engineer Daniel Gallo told SC Media. TeamCity users should monitor servers for unusual activity. LeakIX said a total of 1,711 vulnerable TeamCity servers were detected as of Wednesday, down from the 2,000 it discovered on Monday, according to an X post. "The reason we ultimately disagreed with the coordinated disclosure with Rapid7 was due to their insistence on publishing full exploit details at the same time as a fix being made available to our customers. This would immediately provide attackers with the necessary tools to exploit TeamCity servers without any opportunity for our customers to apply mitigation measures," Gallo told SC Media.
