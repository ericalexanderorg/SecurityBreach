SUMMIT, NJ - The Summit Public School District's internet service provider has confirmed that the District's network has been experiencing "a Denial of Service attack." The attack on the network was detailed in a letter sent to the "Summit Public Schools Community" on October 23 by Superintendent of Schools Scott Hough and subsequently obtained by TAPinto Summit. The letter acknowledges "How difficult the last week has been with the internet interruptions" and offers an "Update on our technology team's efforts to fix the problem." Hough explained that, "A DoS attack is meant to flood a network with traffic, making it difficult for users to access the internet, systems and resources. Our internet service provider has shared that several school districts in New Jersey have also been experiencing the same problem in recent days. It is important to note that this attack has not compromised any of our data or information, and there is no evidence of any security breach or threat to our network." Hough noted that the District is working with its internet service provider to diagnose the problem and "Identify multiple paths for resolving this issue." He added that an updated communication will be sent October 25 informing students in grades 6-12 of instruction plans for October 26, which may become a full remote instruction day. In any event, Grades K-5 will attend school on October 26 as usual.
