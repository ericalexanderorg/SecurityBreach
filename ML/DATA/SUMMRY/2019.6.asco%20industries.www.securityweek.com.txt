Belgium-based aircraft parts maker ASCO Industries has been severely hit by a ransomware attack that started last week. Founded in 1954, ASCO has four manufacturing plants in Belgium, the US, Canada and Germany, and it employs 1,500 people. According to media reports, ASCO's machines were infected with an unidentified piece of ransomware on Friday and the company has been having trouble restoring operations. SecurityWeek has reached out to ASCO for clarifications, but the firm has yet to respond. ASCO representatives said the attackers don't appear to have stolen any information. "The attack against ASCO has once again highlighted the dangerous power of ransomware. The attack has brought operations to a halt and resulted in over a thousand employees being sent home which will be having a significant impact on the organisation financially," Andrea Carcano, CPO and co-founder of Nozomi Networks, told SecurityWeek. Several important organizations have been hit by ransomware over the past year, including Eurofins Scientific, COSCO, Norsk Hydro, the UK Police Federation, and Aebi Schmidt.
