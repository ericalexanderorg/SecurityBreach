Check Point security appliances have been exploited in the wild for at least 30 days. Check Point Security Gateway devices configured with either the "IPSec VPN" or "Mobile Access" software blade are vulnerable. That said simply that "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Check Point VPN. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information." The firm said attackers are using the vulnerability to enumerate and extract password hashes for all local accounts, including the account used to connect to Active Directory, with attackers also seen extracting the "Ntds.dit" file from victims AD servers, within hours of an initial attack against a vulnerable Check Point Gateway. A separate FAQ on CVE-2024-24919, which the advisory does not link to, but which Check Point updated today, paints a more detailed picture of how severe the vulnerability is - including the information that attacks have been taking place in the wild since at least April 30, that no authentication is required and no user interaction either for the exploit. A detailed and irreverent reverse-engineering of the hotfix by offensive security firm WatchTowr saw them conclude that the Check Point vulnerability, CVE-2024-24919, "Wasn't too difficult to find, and was extremely easy to exploit once we'd located it." We refer users to Check Point's FAQ for mitigations, detection and more guidance, as well as WatchTowr's analysis and hopefully by this point guidance from security partners.
