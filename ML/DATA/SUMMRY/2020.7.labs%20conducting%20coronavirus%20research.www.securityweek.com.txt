British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday he was "Absolutely confident" in allegations by the UK and its allies that Russia targeted labs conducting coronavirus research, branding the behaviour "Outrageous and reprehensible". Britain, the United States and Canada on Thursday accused a hacking group called APT29 of spearheading the online attacks on various organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development. Moscow quickly rejected the accusations as "Groundless", and its ambassador to London said in a British television interview Sunday the claims made "No sense". Andrei Kelin, who was appointed Moscow's top envoy in Britain last November, ridiculed the claims in a BBC interview. Kelin also rejected a separate claim by London that "Russian actors" sought to disrupt last year's UK general election. Raab said Thursday that perpetrators in Russia had circulated leaked trade documents between Britain and the United States, in a bid to sow greater division in the contest. Russia and Britain have been at loggerheads since Moscow was accused of trying to kill double agent Sergei Skripal with a powerful military-grade nerve agent in 2018.
