Three days after initial reports that a notorious hacking group had stolen info on more than 500 million Ticketmaster customers - and was attempting to sell the data online - parent company confirmed the breach in a regulatory filing late Friday. On May 20, 2024, Live Nation "Identified unauthorized activity within a third-party cloud database environment containing company data and launched an investigation with industry-leading forensic investigators to understand what happened," the company said in the May 31 SEC filing. On May 27, 2024, a "Criminal threat actor" offered what it alleged to be Ticketmaster user data "For sale via the dark web," according to Live Nation's disclosure. Popular on Variety Currently, Live Nation said, it does not believe the incident has had "a material impact on our overall business operations or on our financial condition or results of operations" - nor does it think the hack is "Reasonably likely" to have a material impact going forward. The hackers offered to sell the stolen Ticketmaster data for $500,000, as first reported by Hackread and Australia's CyberDaily. The confirmation of the Ticketmaster data-security breach comes a little over a week after the Justice Department sued Live Nation on antitrust grounds on May 23, seeking to break up the company. The U.S. government's lawsuit alleged Live Nation and Ticketmaster illegally have used monopoly power to dominate the ticketing business and quash competition.
