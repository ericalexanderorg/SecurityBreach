Facebook filed a lawsuit Wednesday against two Chinese citizens, accusing them of operating a hacking campaign targeting ad accounts on the social network. Hackers have increasingly been going after Facebook ad accounts, using their victims' credit cards to promote posts for fraudulent products, or in some cases spreading malware. In Facebook's lawsuit, the tech giant alleges that Chen Xiao Cong, a Chinese software developer, and Huang Tao, a marketing director for the company GuangZhou HongYi Technology, were behind a similar hacking campaign starting in 2016. The two alleged hackers would take over their victims' accounts and use the victims' money to buy ads for fraudulent products like diet pills, male enhancement supplements and counterfeit goods, according to the lawsuit. A Facebook spokesperson said this hacking campaign is different from the one CNET reported on in November, where the ads led to pages with malware designed to steal credit card information. Facebook is also accusing the two Chinese citizens of "Cloaking," a technique shady advertisers use to disguise links on the social network to avoid triggering its ad reviews process. The alleged hackers had spent at least $4 million from Facebook ads accounts between 2016 and 2019, according to the company.
