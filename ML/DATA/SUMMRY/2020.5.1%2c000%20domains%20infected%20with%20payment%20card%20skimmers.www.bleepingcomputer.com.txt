A security researcher collected in a span of a few weeks over 1,000 domains infected with payment card skimmers, showing that the MageCart continues to be a prevalent threat that preys on insecure webshops. Using freely available tools and some elbow grease, security researcher Max Kersten was able to compile a list of 1,236 domains that were hit by a web skimmer hosted on an external domain. Most of the domains included in the research are already available from other sources, since this one-man effort took some time to reach a conclusion. In the list he provides, the latest detection date for some domains is from 2018. The endeavor to email all 1,236 companies was stopped by Google's spam detection since Kersten's messages were exactly the same, save for the affected domain name and the skimmer detection timestamp. Kersten found affected domains by using a scanner he made to parse and store results from Urlscan.io's API and several rules that detected the malicious JavaScript. IN. UK. DE. AU. BR. FR. IT. NL. CA. ES. The researcher provides in his post the full list of domains where a credit card skimmer was detected.
