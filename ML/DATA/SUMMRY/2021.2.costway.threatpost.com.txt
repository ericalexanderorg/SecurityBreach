Two web skimmers have been discovered on the payment webpages of Costway, one of the top retailers in North America and Europe, which sells appliances, furniture and more. The skimmers are targeting consumers' credit-card payment details. In a twist, researchers say one of these web skimmers is piggybacking on top of the other, to take over the fake forms that had previously been injected onto Costway's site. Researchers first discovered a skimmer that had injected a fake payment form directly onto the checkout page for costway[. "Our crawlers identified that the websites for Costway France, U.K., Germany and Spain, which run the Magento 1 software, had been compromised around the same time frame," said researchers. It's unclear if this particular attack is the work of Magecart - a conglomeration of threat groups that specialize in compromising vulnerable e-commerce stores to inject payment-card skimmers. Researchers have reported that they have seen an uptick in the number of e-commerce sites that are being attacked by Magecart and related groups that utilize web skimming.
