While the United States has no federally-mandated consumer data privacy regulations, organisations still have a responsibility to protect customers' sensitive data. In December 2019, Wawa announced a widespread data breach affecting Point of Sale card reader systems at many of its 850 store locations, exposing customers' financial data and other sensitive information. According to the latest credit union suits, the retailer allegedly failed to adhere to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard with its practice of swiping cards rather than scanning chips, opening the door for fraudsters to steal customers' payment card details. Although most U.S. retailers may not be subject to government fines in response to a data breach, that certainly doesn't mean there aren't consequences - and potentially costly ones at that. While companies won't be fined for a data breach in most of the United States, they can still be subject to hefty legal settlements. Particularly after a difficult year, a data breach - or a lawsuit - is the last thing any organisation needs to start off the new year. To avoid costly legal settlements, data security is a must, even if you may not be legally required to do so.
