Bitdefender researchers have recently investigated a complex and targeted espionage attack on potential government sector victims in South East Asia, carried out by a sophisticated Chinese APT group. The operation dates back to late 2018, with current forensic evidence following the attack timeline up to 2020. This research focuses on dissecting an APT attack and providing a full report on the tools, tactics and techniques used by the sophisticated group during the attack. While the incident has been mentioned by other security researchers, Bitdefender's investigation focuses on offering a detailed timeline of the attack by piecing all the forensic evidence together and creating a case study example. The report also provides a technical analysis of the tools used in this targeted attack and how the components were tied to each other. The attack has a complex and complete arsenal of droppers, backdoors and other tools involving Chinoxy backdoor, PCShare RAT and FunnyDream backdoor binaries, with forensic artefacts pointing towards a sophisticated Chinese actor. First detailed timeline of this attack and the tools, tactics and techniques used.
