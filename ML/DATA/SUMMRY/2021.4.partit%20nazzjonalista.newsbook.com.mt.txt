Avaddon ransomware, the hackers who broke into the IT system of the Partit Nazzjonalista on Monday have given the party 240 hours 'to communicate and cooperate' or else have the documents 'stolen' published on the internet. The hackers wrote on their website that "Partit Nazzjonalista does not want to cooperate with us, so we give them 240 hours to communicate and cooperate with us. If this does not happen before the time counter expires, we will leak valuable company documents". Avaddon ransomware add that "We have company financial data, salary payments, employees' personal documents, banking, private clients' data, payment documents and much more". The hackers remind the PN that "Data cannot be decrypted without our general decryptor." They also threaten the PN that "Your site will be attacked by a DDoS attack." On Monday night Partit Nazzjonalista released a statement saying that its IT systems have been subject to a cyberattack earlier in the day, and that "Potentially, party data may have been accessed without authorisation." According to the statement the party immediately acted to minimise the impact of the cyberattack and alerted the Malta Police Force and the Data Protection Commissioner have been alerted to the case. "The website of Cornell University says that"in ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage until a fee is paid to the criminals. "Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws. Thus, research on prevention and recovery measures to mitigate the impact of such attacks is needed to adapt existing countermeasures to new strains."
