Accutech Systems Corporation faces a proposed class action that claims the trust and wealth management services company failed to take reasonable steps to secure clients' information prior to a data breach last summer. The 33-page lawsuit centers on what's described as a "Massive and preventable cyberattack" that occurred in mid-August 2021 and resulted in the exposure of Accutech clients' personally identifiable information. The case claims Accutech could have prevented the data breach by employing appropriate cybersecurity practices and protocols, including by encrypting or more securely encrypting its servers and clients' personal and financial information. According to the case, data breach victims remain to this day "In the dark" regarding what specific data was accessed, what malware was used and what steps, if any, Accutech has taken to prevent its system from being accessed in the future. "Representative Plaintiff and Class Members are left to speculate as to the full impact of the Data Breach and how exactly Defendant intended to enhance its information security systems and monitoring capabilities so as to prevent further breaches," the complaint states. The lawsuit claims those whose data was exposed during the breach now face a heightened risk of identity theft and fraud or the possibility that their information may end up in the hands of companies who will use it for targeted advertising without their consent, according to the suit. The case looks to represent anyone in the U.S. whose personally identifiable information and/or financial information was exposed to unauthorized third parties as a result of the Accutech Systems data breach that occurred on August 16, 2021.
