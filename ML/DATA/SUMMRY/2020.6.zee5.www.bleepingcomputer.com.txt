A hacker identifying themselves as "John Wick" and "Korean Hackers" claim to have breached the systems for Indian video on demand giant ZEE5 and are threatening to sell the database on criminal markets. In emails with BleepingComputer, the hackers state that they mostly "Help these people to fix the bugs" and request Ethereum for their help. "We are security experts from Korea, We will find bugs and report to the clients if they do not respond we try to make money, We have hacked more 50 Big websites we never sold anything," the threat actors told BleepingComputer. To make matters worse, these hackers have posted partial data from the compromised database, secret keys present in the live source code, references to their Atlassian board, and AWS bucket credentials. Below you can see a picture of the alleged source code for Zee5.com that the hackers claim they have stolen. One of the screenshots, shown below, also has "Dish-tv" network drive on the list, which is noteworthy as Essel Group, who owns ZEE, also owns the satellite TV company, Dish TV. Could this mean the hackers also had access to Dish TV customer information? Lack of sufficient data protection legislation and privacy laws in India may very well allow big corporations to suffer data breaches and not report them without risk of fines.
