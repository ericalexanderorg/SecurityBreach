Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay a $60 million fine for its repeated failures to adequately protect customer data when disposing of old equipment. The United States Department of Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said both Morgan Stanley Bank NA and Morgan Stanley Private Bank NA failed to take proper precautions to protect customer data when it shut down two data centers for its U.S. wealth-management operations in 2016. The OCC also did not impose additional business restrictions on Morgan Stanley on top of the fine because Morgan Stanley had "Undertaken initial corrective actions and is committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to remedy the deficiencies," according to the consent order. It is in line with the p$80 million fine Capital One agreed to pay in connection the 2019 data breach that affected approximately 106 million people. Morgan Stanley previously agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $1 million after a broker downloaded client data onto his personal computer. The agreement doesn't mean Morgan Stanley is done dealing with the aftermath of the 2016 breach as the bank is facing at least two class-action lawsuits alleging negligence and invasion of privacy. "In addition to Morgan Stanley's failure to prevent the Data Breach, Defendant failed to detect the Data Breach for years, and when they did discover the Data Breach, it took them over a year, possibly longer, to report it to the affected individuals and the states' Attorneys General," the lawsuit said.
