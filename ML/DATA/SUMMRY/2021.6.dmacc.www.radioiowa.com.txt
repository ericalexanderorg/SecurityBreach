The president of Des Moines Area Community College says the institution's insurance company continues to negotiate with hackers who shut down DMACC's computer networks on June 2. Rob Denson says it does not appear any accounts were compromised. "Our insurance company is talking to the threat actor. We're not a part of that discussion at this point," Denson says. Denson has confirmed it was a ransomware attack, but DMACC did not pay a ransom and has relied upon its insurer to handle the details. "They brought in all kinds of attorneys, consultants that have worked with us and have been through many, many of these," Denson said. Experts have gone through over 6000 DMACC computers, searching for malicious software, but Denson says none was found. Denson made his comments during taping of the "Iowa Press" program that airs this Friday night on Iowa PBS. DMACC canceled online classes on June 3 and wound up closing the entire campus on June 4 due to the security breach.
