In late February 2024 Change Healthcare suffered a devastating ransomware attack which led to major disruptions to the company's platform, estimated at a staggering $872,000,000. The attack which was carried out by BlackCat ransomware group also resulted in a $22,000,000 ransom payment. In a testimony by Andrew Witty, Change Healthcare's CEO, it is revealed that the hackers gained access using a single compromised Citrix credential on an account that had no MFA in place -. "While we will learn more and our understanding may change, here's what I can share today. On February 12, criminals used compromised credentials to remotely access a Change Healthcare Citrix portal, an application used to enable remote access to desktops. The portal did not have multi-factor authentication. Once the threat actor gained access, they moved laterally within the systems in more sophisticated ways and exfiltrated data. Ransomware was deployed nine days later." Credentials obtained from info-stealer infections, which have become the primary initial attack vector in recent years, provide threat actors with easy entry points into companies, facilitating data breaches and ransomware attacks. It's crucial to underscore that Hudson Rock had the data of this employee's compromised data a day after the infection, highlighting a missed opportunity to preemptively safeguard against this incident. Info-stealer infections as a cybercrime trend surged by an incredible 6000% since 2018, positioning them as the primary initial attack vector used by threat actors to infiltrate organizations and execute cyberattacks, including ransomware, data breaches, account overtakes, and corporate espionage.
