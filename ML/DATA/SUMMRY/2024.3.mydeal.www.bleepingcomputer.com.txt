Woolworths' MyDeal subsidiary has disclosed a data breach affecting 2.2 million customers, with the hacker trying to sell the stolen data on a hacker forum. MyDeal has already begun to send data breach notifications to affected customers and say that customers who do not receive one were not affected. On Sunday, the hacker behind the MyDeal breach began selling the stolen data on a hacking forum for $600. The hacker claims that the data currently consists of 1 million entries but that the number of exposed customers will increase as they finish parsing the database. Today, the threat actor released samples of the stolen data, exposing the personal information of 286 alleged MyDeal customers. As it is common for threat actors to purchase stolen data to use in their own attacks, all MyDeal customers should also be on the lookout for targeted phishing attacks.
