Hackers holding the Nationalist Party to ransom in order not to publish data seized from a computer system, are asking for €5,000 from the party. The party was given 240 hours to pay the ransom demanded, after which the hacker group said it will dump all the data hacked from the PN onto its dark web site, for anyone to see and download. That deadline expires at 5.30am on Thursday. Although the Avaddon ransomware used to hack the PN is the creation of an international hacking gang, the probability is that the attack could have been carried out by an affiliate rather than the group itself, even one based in Malta. PN secretary-general Francis Zammit Dimech, while not confirming the €5,000 ransom amount, insisted that the party would not negotiate with the hackers. The PN also brought in IT experts to mitigate the effect of the data hack. "People experience hacking of their personal WhatsApp and Facebook accounts and we have also seen large entities - including a well-established bank and a Malta Government public entity - that were hacked or had much of their data wiped clean and then had to be rebuilt from scratch," he said. The escalation tactic usually involves a name-and-shame of victims, data leak of samples of stolen data, and finally a dump or auction of data.
