The perpetrators "Gained access to files and confidential personal information by exploiting a vulnerability" in Accellion's File Transfer Appliance, which is used by the UC for transference of sensitive information. Individuals who receive emails threatening to publish stolen personal information are advised to forward them to their local information security department. According to UC, the stolen information "Includes but is not limited to names, addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers and bank account information for a range of UC populations, including employees and their dependents and beneficiaries, retirees and their beneficiaries, students and their families, and potentially other individuals with connections to UC.". Despite the UC notifying students and faculty of the data breach on March 31, the information was not widespread until students took to social media platforms, such as Twitter, to alert alumni and other members of the UC community. UC is among a large group of universities, including Stanford University and the University of Miami, who use third-party transfer services provided by Accellion and have been affected by the data breach. UCLA began investigating suspicious activity in conjunction with the FBI in October 2014, and officially determined that the network containing personal information of UCLA Health affiliates was compromised on May 5, 2015. Health care information and other personal information were also compromised at the time.
