Brown-Forman, one of the largest U.S. companies in the spirits and wine business, suffered a cyber attack. The intruders allegedly copied 1TB of confidential data; they plan on selling to the highest bidder the most important info and leak the rest. Sodinokibi ransomware operators announced on Friday that they had compromised Brown-Forman's computer network and spent more than a month examining user services, cloud data storage, and general structure. Following the incursion, the attackers claim they stole 1TB of data that includes confidential information about employees, company agreements, contracts, financial statements, and internal correspondence. The company confirmed the attack for BleepingComputer, adding that there is a strong suspicion that data was stolen from their systems. "Unfortunately, we believe some information, including employee data, was impacted. We are working closely with law enforcement, as well as world-class third-party data security experts, to mitigate and resolve this situation as soon as possible," the Brown-Forman spokesperson told us. Brown-Forman detected the attack and stopped it before data was locked, a company representative told BleepingComputer.
