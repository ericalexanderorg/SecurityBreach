Chinese hackers have stolen information from Spanish laboratories working on a vaccine for COVID19, El Pais newspaper revealed. The El Pais newspaper reported that Chinese hackers have stolen information from Spanish laboratories working on a vaccine for COVID19. While pharmaceutical companies worldwide are working on the research of a vaccine for the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, threat actors are conducting cyber espionage campaigns in the attempt of stealing information on the work. "The CNI director said that"sensitive sectors such as health and pharmaceutics" had been targeted, and that there has been "a particularly virulent campaign, and not just in Spain, against laboratories working on a vaccine for Covid-19.". According to Spain's secret service chief Paz Esteban, the laboratories were hit by "a particularly virulent campaign," the hackers hit centers working on the development of vaccine in Spain and abroad. Speaking at a seminar organized by the Association of European Journalists on Thursday, Esteban explained that the frequency and the level of sophistication increased during the lockdown. Chinese officials denied any involvement in the attacks explaining that their country is ahead in the research on the COVID19 vaccine. In July, US DoJ charged two Chinese hackers working with China's Ministry of State Security with hacking into computer systems of government organizations and companies worldwide.
