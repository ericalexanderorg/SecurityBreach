Media conglomerate Nikkei Inc. has fallen victim to a business email compromise scam that fleeced the company out of $29 million. Nikkei is Japan's largest financial media organization and lends its name to Japan's premier stock index, which is the equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the U.S. It owns several publications worldwide, including the Financial Times and the Nikkei Asian Review. The scam stems from a September incident involving an employee of Nikkei America, the U.S. subsidiary of Nikkei. The employee transferred $29 million to a fraudulent bank account, on instructions from BEC scammers purporting to be a Nikkei management executive. Threatpost has reached out to Nikkei America for further details. Information is currently scant due to maintaining "The confidentiality of the investigation by relevant authorities," but experts told Threatpost that the incident appears to have tell-tale signs that it is a form of BEC called vendor email compromise, where a third party is compromised and their account is then used for the attack. BEC scams are squeezing more money than ever out of victims, with losses from the attacks almost doubling year-over-year in 2018 to reach $1.2 billion, according to the FBI's annual Internet Crime Report released in April.
