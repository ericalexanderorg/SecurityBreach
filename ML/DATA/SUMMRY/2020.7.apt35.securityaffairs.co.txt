Iran-linked APT35 group accidentally exposed one of its servers, leaving online roughly 40 GB of videos and other files associated with its operations. Researchers at IBM X-Force Incident Response Intelligence Services discovered an unsecured server belonging to Iran-linked APT35 group containing data for many domains managed by the threat actor. "Now, due to operational errors-a basic misconfiguration-by suspected ITG18 associates, a server with more than 40 gigabytes of data on their operations has been analyzed by X-Force IRIS analysts." reads the analysis published by IBM. The experts found several files on the server, roughly five hours of training videos recorded by the APT group. Microsoft has been tracking the threat actors at least since 2013, but experts believe that the cyberespionage group has been active since at least 2011. Some of the leaked files showed that the APT35 group has also targeted an Iranian-American philanthropist and officials in the U.S. Department of State. Other videos demonstrate that the hackers of the APT35 group were not attempting to validate credentials against sites that were set up with multifactor authentication. "IBM X-Force IRIS considers ITG18 a determined threat group with a significant investment in its operations. The group has shown persistence in its operations and consistent creation of new infrastructure despite multiple public disclosures and broad reporting on its activity."
