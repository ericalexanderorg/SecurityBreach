Some of the activists were hacked using two zero-click iMessage exploits: the 2020 KISMET exploit and a 2021 exploit that we call FORCEDENTRY. The hacked activists included three members of Waad, three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, two exiled Bahraini dissidents, and one member of Al Wefaq. At least four of the activists were hacked by LULU, a Pegasus operator that we attribute with high confidence to the government of Bahrain, a well-known abuser of spyware. Pegasus Hacking of Bahraini Activists The government of Bahrain appears to have purchased NSO Group's Pegasus spyware in 2017. LULU: A Bahrain Government Operator We attributed the hacking of Activists A-D to a Bahrain government operator of Pegasus that we call LULU. Like PEARL, LULU appeared to be spying exclusively in Bahrain and Qatar. A 2016 investigation by Bahrain Watch and The Intercept that reviewed Bahraini court documents showed that the Bahraini government was using phone forensics technology sold by Cellebrite to extract private data from arrested activists' phones. The sale of Pegasus to Bahrain is particularly egregious, considering that there is significant, longstanding, and documented evidence of Bahrain's serial misuse of surveillance products including Trovicor, FinFisher, Cellebrite, and, now, NSO Group. For NSO Group to sell Pegasus to Bahrain in light of this evidence is gross negligence in the name of profit.
