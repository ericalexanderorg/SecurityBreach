A Magecart skimmer, discovered on the site of First Aid Beauty, was only just removed after being in place for five months. The website of popular skin care brand First Aid Beauty has been hacked by the infamous Magecart group, which embedded digital card skimmers on the site to steal visitors' payment-card information. Researcher Willem de Groot told Threatpost that he discovered the skimmer on the website, which had been active since May 5. Digital card skimmers, which are scripts injected into websites to steal data that's entered into online payment forms on e-commerce websites, are a favorite of groups under the Magecart umbrella. A de-obfuscated version of the Magecart skimmer code used on the First Aid Beauty website shows that it looks for website visitors' credit card numbers, credit card owner name, expiration date and CVV number. More recently, in August it was disclosed that more than 80 global eCommerce sites were actively compromised by Magecart groups, while a September report found that a faction of the Magecart threat group is testing code that targets routers used to provide free or paid Wi-Fi services in public spaces and hotel. "Websites can protect against Magecart by running server-side malware and vulnerability detection software minimizing the amount of Javascript on their checkout pages and using SRI and CSP technology to ensure integrity of third party Javascript assets," he told Threatpost.
