A man accused of hacking UK National Lottery accounts via credential stuffing attacks has been sentenced to nine months in prison, the UK's National Crime Agency reported on Friday. According to the NCA, Batson used a tool called Sentry MBA to launch credential stuffing attacks on accounts belonging to National Lottery customers. These credentials are often obtained as a result of third-party breaches and the credential stuffing attacks can have a high success rate given that many people use the same username and password combination for multiple online accounts. The NCA said Batson used Sentry MBA to launch attacks against Camelot, the company that runs the National Lottery, and also provided instructions to others on how to do so. When the attack against the National Lottery was announced by Camelot in November 2016, the company said hackers had accessed roughly 26,500 accounts. The NCA says there are approximately 9 million records in the National Lottery customer database. The NCA said on Friday that Akinwunmi had stolen Â£13 from the account of one lottery player whose username and password he had received from Batson.
