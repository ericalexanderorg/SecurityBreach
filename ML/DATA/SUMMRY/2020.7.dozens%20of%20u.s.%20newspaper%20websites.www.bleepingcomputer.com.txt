The Evil Corp gang hacked into dozens of US newspaper websites owned by the same company to infect the employees of over 30 major US private firms using fake software update alerts displayed by the malicious SocGholish JavaScript-based framework. Researchers with Symantec's Threat Intelligence team who discovered these attacks say that the company who owns the compromised news sites was alerted and the malicious code was removed. Dozens of US newspaper websites owned by the same parent company were compromised by attackers in order to infect potential targets. Symantec previously said in a report published on June 26 that it blocked the Evil Corp gang from deploying WastedLocker ransomware payloads in attacks against 31 large private companies, including 30 US corporations, including "11 listed companies, eight of which are Fortune 500 companies." "The attackers had breached the networks of targeted organizations and were in the process of laying the groundwork for staging ransomware attacks." As the Symantec researchers explained, Evil Corp's attacks started with the SocGholish framework being used to infect targets who visited over 150 hacked websites. Evil Corp refreshed their tactics and are now again in involved in the ransomware "Business," deploying their new WastedLocker ransomware in targeted attacks against businesses and asking for ransoms of millions of dollars.
