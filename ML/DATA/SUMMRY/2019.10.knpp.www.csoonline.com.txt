If you think attacking civilian infrastructure is a war crime, you'd be right, but spies from countries around the world are fighting a silent, dirty war to pre-position themselves on civilian infrastructure - like energy-producing civilian nuclear plants - to be able to commit sabotage during a moment of geopolitical tension. What follows is an explanation of how India's Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant got hacked - and how it could have been easily avoided. Pukhraj Singh, a "Noted cyber intelligence specialist" who was "Instrumental in setting up of the cyber-warfare operations centre of the National Technical Research Organisation," according to The New Indian Express, tweeted: "So, it's public now. Domain controller-level access Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. The government was notified way back. Extremely mission-critical targets were hit," noting in a quote tweet that he was aware of the attack as early as September 7, 2019, calling it a "Causus belli". At first the Nuclear Power Plant Corporation of India denied it. In a press release they decried "False information" on social media and insisted the KNPP nuclear power plant is "Stand alone and not connected to outside cyber network and internet" and that "Any cyber attack on the Nuclear Power Plant Control System is not possible." On October 30, the NPCI confirmed that malware was in fact discovered on their systems, and that CERT-India first noticed the attack on September 4, 2019. Numerous security researchers downloaded and analyzed the malware from VirusTotal, and many noted the code similarities with malware previously attributed to North Korea's Lazarus group.
