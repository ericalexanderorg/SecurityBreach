Coding similarities suggest a possible link with multiple campaigns over several years. By January 2020, they were joined by researchers from ESET. In January 2020, Avast detected a new campaign targeting a Central Asian telecommunications company. What isn't clear is whether all these campaigns have been waged by the same group, or whether multiple groups have access to the same Mikroceen malware family. "But we cannot with certainty attribute all of these campaigns to the same group. It is possible that there are multiple APT groups sharing resources, but I don't want to speculate." In its Vicious Panda research, Check Point noted the similarities to earlier campaigns, and said, "A closer look at this campaign allowed us to tie it to other operations which were carried out by the same anonymous group, dating back to at least 2016. Over the years, these operations targeted different sectors in multiple countries, such as Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus." While there is no certainty, the general feeling is that these multiple campaigns have been operated by a single group. Going forward, as more is learned and more campaigns are discovered, this will need to be remedied; There are two obvious candidates for this unnamed APT group: Vicious Panda, or the Mikroceen Gang.
