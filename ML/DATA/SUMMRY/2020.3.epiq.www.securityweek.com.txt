Legal services company Epiq has taken its systems offline globally after being hit by a piece of ransomware. "As part of our comprehensive response plan, we immediately took our systems offline globally to contain the threat and began working with a third-party forensic firm to conduct an independent investigation," Epiq said in a statement. It's unclear which ransomware was involved in the attack and how many of Epiq's systems were impacted. TechCrunch learned from an Epiq employee that the ransomware affected the company's entire fleet of computers across its 80 global offices. The company's website, which is currently offline, includes a data security section where the company claims it has a full-time information security team and highly secure, geographically dispersed data centers to reduce the risk of data exposure. Ransomware attacks can cause serious problems for major organizations, and several big companies reported being hit over the past year, including Norwegian metals and energy giant Norsk Hydro, Australian shipping giant Toll, Aircraft parts maker ASCO, Mexican oil company Pemex, and testing services provider Eurofins Scientific. The DHS revealed recently that a piece of ransomware disrupted operations at some natural gas facilities, and an electric utility in Massachusetts informed customers last month that a ransomware infection had disrupted business operations.
