> The malware found installed a 'backdoor' by using a known vulnerability in FortiGate devices. The publication of the MIVD therefore does not describe any new vulnerability in all FortiGate devices. I could believe factory backdoors in Fortinet products, including bugdoors, but it's even easier to believe commonplace unintended software defects. Edit: This comment was a response to the HN title "China spied on Dutch Cyber Intelligence through FortiGate backdoors". Occasionally, a proven intentional vulnerability will happen, so we want to be careful not to cry wolf other times. It's reasonable to be cautious about Fortinet in general, but I don't think the fact that a known vulnerability was exploited suggests that the vulnerability was intentional. The first time I heard the idea, someone was claiming publicly that a manager/lead at a tech vendor had been approached by a government, and asked to insert a backdoor that would look accidental, and without the larger organization aware.
