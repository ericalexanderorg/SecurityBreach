We were recently the target of a phishing campaign that successfully accessed some of the code we store in GitHub. In today's evolving threat landscape, people are inundated with messages and notifications, making phishing lures hard to detect. In September, GitHub detailed one such phishing campaign, in which a threat actor accessed GitHub accounts by impersonating the code integration and delivery platform CircleCI. We recently learned that Dropbox was targeted by a similar campaign. At no point did this threat actor have access to the contents of anyone's Dropbox account, their password, or their payment information. To date, our investigation has found that the code accessed by this threat actor contained some credentials-primarily, API keys-used by Dropbox developers. In early October, multiple Dropboxers received phishing emails impersonating CircleCI, with the intent of targeting our GitHub accounts. Our security teams work tirelessly to keep Dropbox worthy of our customer's trust.
