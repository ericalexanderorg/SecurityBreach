After Facebook and LinkedIn, Domino's India became a victim of a major data breach. Alon Gal, the co-founder of an Israeli cybercrime intelligence, stated that the hackers have accessed 13TB of internal data of Domino's India. The credit card details of around 10 lakh of its customers have been leaked on the Dark Web. The hacker has gained access to all the details of the customer and 18 crore order details which comprise the name of customers, email IDs, phone numbers, delivery address, and payment details which comprises over 10 lakh credit card details that were used to buy on Domino's India app. India has fallen prey to data breaches several times. Most of the time, these data breaches are not reported. In the recent past, there have been several data breach incidents involving Indian firms which include Bigbasket, BuyUcoin, JusPay, Upstox, and others.
