Thousands of Magento-powered online stores have been hacked over the past few days as part of a skimming campaign that has been described as the "Largest ever." The attack is being monitored by Sansec, a Netherlands-based cybersecurity company that specializes in solutions designed to counter digital skimming. Sansec on Monday reported seeing nearly 2,000 Magento stores that have been compromised as part of this campaign since Friday - over 1,000 stores were hacked on Saturday, more than 600 on Sunday, and over 200 so far on Monday. A majority of the impacted sites were powered by Magento 1, but some were running Magento 2. "The previous record was 962 hacked stores in a single day in July last year," the company explained in a blog post. "The massive scope of this weekend's incident illustrates increased sophistication and profitability of web skimming. Criminals have been increasingly automating their hacking operations to run web skimming schemes on as many stores as possible." While the attack is still being investigated, the cybersecurity firm believes the cybercriminals might be using a new Magento exploit that was offered a few weeks ago on a hacking forum for $5,000.
