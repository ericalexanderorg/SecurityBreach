A live broadcast by Australia's Channel Nine TV station was taken offline by a cyber attack on Sunday evening, the station has confirmed. The attack on Channel Nine coincided with "Technical disruption" at Australia's Parliament House where MPs and senators lost email access over the weekend. As a precaution, the service was cut off from the rest of the government's systems as soon as it was detected and Australia's Cyber Security Centre has been brought in to investigate. At this stage, it isn't clear whether the parliamentary outage and the cyber attack on Channel Nine were connected. "This is a timely reminder that Australians cannot be complacent about their cyber security," Hastie told News.com. "Cyber security is a team effort and a shared responsibility. It is vital that Australian businesses and organisations are alert to this threat and take the necessary steps to ensure our digital sovereignty."
