China-backed hackers have had access to some major U.S. critical infrastructure for "At least five years," according to an intelligence advisory released Wednesday. Details: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released an advisory Wednesday to warn critical infrastructure operators about China's ongoing hacking interests. The group has relied heavily on stolen administrator credentials to maintain access to the systems - and in some cases it has maintained access for "At least five years," per the advisory. Volt Typhoon has been seen controlling some victims' surveillance camera systems, and its access could have allowed the group to disrupt critical energy and water controls. Between the lines: U.S. officials are increasingly worried China will launch destructive cyberattacks either during or in the lead up to a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Last May, Microsoft and the U.S. government warned that Volt Typhoon had been positioning itself to launch attacks on infrastructure across the country, including water utilities and ports. The big picture: U.S. critical infrastructure is riddled with security problems, including poor password management and a lack of procedures to install security updates.
