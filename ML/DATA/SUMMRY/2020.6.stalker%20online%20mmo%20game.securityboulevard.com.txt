This week, Cyber News researchers announced that cyber thieves are offering for sale more than 1.3 million user records from the free-to-play Stalker Online MMO game on dark web marketplaces. The data leak was discovered by the team overseeing the dark web-monitoring project implemented by the independent cybersecurity research publication, and contains personal identifiable information such as email addresses, usernames, passwords, phone numbers and IP addresses. The first contains over 1.2 million user records, while the second includes over 136,000 user records from Stalker Online forums. According to an announcement by the researchers, the trove of data was found on May 5, after the attacker opened a Stalker Online database thread on a dark web forum. As proof of his successful server compromise, the hacker also posted a link that directs users to a page on the official Stalker Online website containing the intruder's message. "Contact us on [redacted] for assistance in securing your web server. If not reach within 24 hours - data gathered will be posted for all to download.". The game has an extensive reach in Russia and Eastern Europe, and gamers are advised to immediately change the password to their online account.
