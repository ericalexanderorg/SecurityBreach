Japanese defense contractors Pasco and Kobe Steel this week disclosed cyber intrusions they suffered back in 2016 and 2018. Pasco is Japan's largest geospatial service provider and Kobe Steel is a major steel manufacturer. The two companies disclosed the breaches after Japan's Ministry of Defense announced last week that two unnamed contractors, in addition to Mitsubishi Electric and NEC, had been targeted in cyberattacks. Pasco also said it had not found any evidence that personal or business information had been exfiltrated, but in Kobe's case some files may have been stolen. Mitsubishi Electric reported in January that it discovered a breach in June 2019. NEC said the attackers gained access to tens of thousands of files, but it had found no evidence that information was leaked. The attacks on Mitsubishi Electric, NEC and Pasco are believed to have been carried out by Chinese hackers.
