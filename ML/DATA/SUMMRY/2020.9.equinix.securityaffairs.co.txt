Equinix, one of the leaders in the global colocation data center market share, with 205 data centers in 25 countries on five continents, was hit by Netwalker ransomware operators. "Our data centers and our service offerings, including managed services, remain fully operational, and the incident has not affected our ability to support our customers." The screenshot shared by the Netwalker ransomware operators shows folders from infected systems allegedly containing company data, including financial information and data center reports. The Netwalker ransomware gang is asking the victims to contact them within 3 days to avoid the leak of the stolen data. "Note that as most customers operate their own equipment within Equinix data centers, this incident has had no impact on their operations or the data on their equipment at Equinix." concludes the statement.
