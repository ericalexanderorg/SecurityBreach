The Jamaican Government has hinted that it will punish anyone found guilty of breaching the JAMCOVID web portal with findings from an independent review expected to be turned over to the Holness administration today. In a statement issued Thursday evening, the Ministry of National Security said the identified vulnerability has since been rectified. "Under Jamaican law, we also have a duty to ensure that any unauthorised access to data is investigated and prosecuted," the ministry said in the press statement. Zack Whittaker, the security editor at TechCrunch, said he had sent details of the exposed server to a Ministry of Health and Wellness official from February 14. An official at the health ministry, who requested anonymity, denied having received any questions about the JAMCOVID breach. "They helped to narrow down the source of the breach and the owner of the server - a Jamaican government contractor, Amber Group." Whittaker said a short while after speaking to Amber Group Chief Executive Officer Dushyant Savadia, the exposed data were secured.
