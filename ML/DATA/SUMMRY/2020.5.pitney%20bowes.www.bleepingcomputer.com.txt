Global business services company Pitney Bowes recently stopped an attack from Maze ransomware operators before the encryption routine could be deployed but the actor still managed to steal some data. Maze operators today published multiple screenshots of directories on Pitney Bowes computers. A Pitney Bowes spokesperson has told BleepingComputer that the company detected the intrusion and is currently investigating the scope of the attack. "Working with our third-party security consultants, we immediately took critical steps to thwart the attack before data could be encrypted," - Pitney Bowes representative. Unlike other posts from Maze about their victims, the one for Pitney Bowes does not have a lock date, indicating an encryption operation did not deploy. The post from the attacker's site contains an archive with snapshots of a folder tree from Pitney Bowes systems and email addresses for two current and a former senior vice president. Pitney Bowes told BleepingComputer that at this stage of the investigation "There is no evidence of further unauthorized access to our IT systems." However, the company is still looking into the incident.
