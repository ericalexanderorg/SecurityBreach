DarkHotel nation-state actor is exploiting a VPN zero-day to breach Chinese government agencies in Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese security-firm Qihoo 360 has uncovered a hacking campaign conducted by a DarkHotel APT group aimed at Chinese government agencies in Beijing and Shanghai. Since March, more than 200 VPN servers have been compromised by hackers, including 174 systems belonging to Chinese institutions abroad. Experts observed Coronavirus-themed attacks launched by the group since March. In this scenario, VPN are widely adopted, and it is not surprising that threat actors attempted to exploit vulnerabilities in VPN servers. "Recently, Qihoo 360 captured malicious samples issued through hijacked security services of a domestic VPN vendor SangFor. The targeted attack was initiated by Darkhotel, a Peninsula APT Group, targeting Chinese institutions abroad and relevant government units. Up to now, a large number of VPN users have been attacked." reads the analysis published by Qihoo 360. Once the attackers have breached the target Sangfor VPN server exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, they replaced the SangforUD.exe program with a backdoored version that is hard to distinguish. "The vulnerability exists in an update that is triggered automatically when the VPN client starts to connect to the server. The client will obtain update from the configuration file at a fixed location on the connected VPN server, and download a program called SangforUD.exe. Due to the lack of security awareness of the developers, there are security risks in the entire update process. The client compares the version of the update program without doing any other security checks. This leaves a security flaw that the hackers can tamper the update configuration file and replace the update program after hacking the VPN server." continues the researchers.
