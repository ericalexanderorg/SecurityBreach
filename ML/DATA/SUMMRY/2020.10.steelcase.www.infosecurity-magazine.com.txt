A multibillion-dollar furniture maker has become the latest big name apparently hit by a major ransomware attack. Steelcase, the world's largest maker of office furniture, revealed the attack in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "The company is actively engaged in restoring the affected systems and returning to normal levels of operations." "At this stage it's unclear which variant was responsible for the attack, although Steelcase said it is not aware of any data being stolen from its systems"or any other loss of assets as a result of this attack. IT services giant Cognizant, for example, claimed in May that an attack a month earlier may end up costing it $70m in Q2 2020 alone. Steelcase certainly fits the bill as a target for "Big game hunting" ransomware groups like Ryuk, Maze and REvil. The Steelcase attack came in the same week that French IT services giant Sopra Steria fell victim to what it claimed to be a new variant of the prolific Ryuk family.
