According to IBM's X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services, ZeroCleare was involved in a recently spotted APT attack in which it compromised a Windows machine via a vulnerable driver. ZeroCleare then pivoted to spread to other devices on the network - setting up the groundwork for a potentially catastrophic attack. "Since ZeroCleare relies on the EldoS RawDisk driver, which is not a signed driver and would therefore not run by default, the attackers use an intermediary file named soy.exe to perform the workaround," according to the analysis. APT34 likely also collaborated on the destructive portion of the ZeroCleare attack with at least one other group, researchers found. Threatpost has reached out to IRIS for more details on the targets and result of the ZeroCleare attack. Wiper attacks - which focus on destroying infrastructure and disrupting operations rather than on data exfiltration - have been on the rise in 2019, with IRIS observing a 200-percent increase in their telemetry over the past six months. "The destructive attacks we have seen are being carried out by threat actors of varying motivations who could be employing destructive components in their attacks," according to the analysis.
