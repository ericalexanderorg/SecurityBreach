T-Mobile confirmed over the weekend that data belonging to over one million of its customers has been exposed following a system breach. Financial data such as credit card numbers, social security numbers and passwords are believed to be unaffected. The company said all affected individuals have been, or will shortly be, notified, adding that customers should check they have up-to-date contact details on their account in the event the company needs to reach them. T-Mobile confirmed to TechCrunch that less than 1.5% of its customers were affected, amounting to more than one million of the 75 million customers the company currently services. T-Mobile hasn't disclosed how the breach took place, whether data was stolen or how long the data was exposed for, but it did say it was fixed "Promptly" after it took place in early November and that the relevant authorities have since been alerted. The data accessed isn't inherently high-risk for the user given that passwords and financial information were not accessed, however if any data was taken, it's important that customers be on the look out for sophisticated phishing scams.
