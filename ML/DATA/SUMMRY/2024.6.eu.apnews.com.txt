ATHENS, Greece - Disruptive digital attacks, many linked to Russian-backed groups, have doubled in the European Union in recent months and are also targeting election-related services, according to the EU's top cybersecurity official. Juhan Lepassaar, head of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, or ENISA, told The Associated Press in an interview that attacks with geopolitical motives have steadily risen since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. "The number of hacktivist attacks European infrastructure - threat actors whose main aim is to cause disruption - has doubled from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024," Lepassaar said late Tuesday at the agency's headquarters in Athens. Citizens from the EU's 27 member states will vote June 6-9 for lawmakers in the European Parliament in an election that will also shape the EU's executive branch, the European Commission. ENISA has led exercises and intense consultations to harden the resilience of election-related agencies in the EU for the past seven months. In an annual report for 2023, the agency noted a surge in ransomware attacks and incidents targeting public institutions. "It's been emphasized, also by member states' cybersecurity agencies, that AI-enabled disinformation and information manipulation is a big threat," Lepassaar said.
