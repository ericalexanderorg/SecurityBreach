A new ransomware attack is affecting the Texas government. Less than a week ago, on May 8, the Texas court system was the victim of the same type of attack, which resulted in servers being taken offline to prevent malware from spreading on the network. "The Texas Department of Transportation determined that on May 14, 2020, there was unauthorized access to the agency's network in a ransomware event" - TxDOT. Immediate action was taken to isolate affected computers from the network and block further unauthorized access. TxDOT is responsible for air, road, and railway transportation across Texas. The attack on the Texas court system Was identified by the Office of Court Administration, which is the IT provider for the appellate courts and state judicial agencies in Texas. It occurred on a Friday night, which is typically when ransomware operators strike because fewer employees are present and the attack has a better chance of being executed successfully. A ransomware incident last year in August that affected 22 local governments in Texas came with a collective ransom demand of $2.5 million.
