TransLink, the transportation agency of Metro Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, has been hit by ransomware, and the ransom note delivered by the attackers suggests the incident involved a piece of ransomware named Egregor. TransLink first reported issues related to its IT systems on December 1, when it informed customers that some online services may be unavailable. TransLink restoried payment services on Thursday and said the incident has not impacted transit services and transit safety systems. TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond confirmed in a statement issued late on Thursday that the company was targeted in a ransomware attack, and said the attack "Included communications to TransLink through a printed message." Global BC reporter Jordan Armstrong reported on Twitter that the attack involved the ransom note being sent to TransLink printers. He has clarified that TransLink uses a third-party payment processor for fare transactions and it does not store payment data. Egregor is a relatively new piece of ransomware that was first spotted in late September.
