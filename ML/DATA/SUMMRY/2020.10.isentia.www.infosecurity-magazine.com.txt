Media monitoring giant Isentia has revealed that it is currently dealing with a major security incident disrupting some online services. The Sydney-headquartered firm, which has operations in eight markets, revealed the news in a regulatory filing with the Australian Securities Exchange yesterday. Although ransomware wasn't mentioned by name, reports suggest it is the cause of the incident, which Isentia admitted is disrupting services in its SaaS Mediaportal platform. "Isentia is taking urgent steps to contain the incident and conduct a full investigation into what happened and how to avoid a repeat occurrence in the future," said CEO, Ed Harrison in a statement to the ASX. "Our priority is to restore full service as soon as possible but until that occurs, we have put processes in place to support our customers." "Steve Forbes, government cybersecurity expert at Nominet, argued that the attack therefore highlights the"interconnected world of national cyber-defense. Isentia has notified the Australian Cyber Security Center about the incident and said it is currently working with "Leading external cybersecurity specialists" to determine its extent and the impact on key systems. That would seem to suggest that the firm was caught off-guard by the attack and that it is still struggling to contain the incident.
