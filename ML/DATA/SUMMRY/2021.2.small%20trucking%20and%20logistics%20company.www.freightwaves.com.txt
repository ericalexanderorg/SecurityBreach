George got the email a week after the ransomware attack on the small trucking and logistics company he manages. Ransomware attack unthinkable for 'a company like us'. The company, based in a town in the U.S., is among hundreds of thousands of small trucking companies that keep the supply chain going. "Being a small company in a small town, you would have never thought a company like us would get targeted," George said. George's company was targeted by a ransomware gang that uses a double-extortion tactic. George isn't sure how the ransomware attack happened in the first place. While phishing e-mails do represent the single most common way ransomware attacks breach company systems, attacks come through a wide array of means, including unsecured servers and remote connection.
