Psychotherapy centre Vastamo's information system may have been subject to two separate data breaches, the company said in a press release on Saturday night. Earlier this week, Vastaamo announced its patient database has been hacked and that extortionists were demanding payment of nearly half a million euros for the data's return. The first breach reportedly took place in November 2018. The blackmailer has already published sensitive information of at least 300 people online. Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo said on Saturday that the hacking of the psychotherapy centre must be taken very seriously. "Discussions have already taken place with key ministers, but the concrete measures needed still need to be reviewed," Ohisalo said. "First of all, this is not the first time and certainly, not the last time either. This is a very serious hack," she added.
