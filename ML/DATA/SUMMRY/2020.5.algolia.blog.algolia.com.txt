Servers were continuing to fire alerts, shutting down one by one, without a clear cause, and remote access to these servers was also impossible. Being able to deploy packages to be installed, setting up services and maintaining them on thousands of servers is a must-have. More than five hundred servers were impacted, most of them temporarily losing indexing service, but some of them also losing search capabilities. What we did so far: We've secured the impacted SaltStack service by updating it and adding additional IP filtering, allowing only our servers to connect to it. We're rotating security keys necessary for communication with the SaltStack service, both on our application servers and on SaltStack servers. We're restricting access keys of our control plane services to specific IPs of servers where they're expected to be accessed and used from. As an added security measure, we're going to reinstall all of the servers in our infrastructure that had contact with the SaltStack to ensure all servers are clean of any unexpected changes.
