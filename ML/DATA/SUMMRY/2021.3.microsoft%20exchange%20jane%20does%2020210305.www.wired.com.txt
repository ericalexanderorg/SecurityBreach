Earlier this week that Chinese hackers were actively targeting Microsoft Exchange servers, the cybersecurity community warned that the zero-day vulnerabilities they were exploiting might have allowed them to hit countless organizations around the world. The hackers appear to have responded to Microsoft's patch, released Tuesday, by ramping up and automating their hacking campaign. One security researcher involved in the investigation who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity put the number of hacked Exchange servers at more than 30,000 in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands worldwide, all apparently by the same group. That means only a small number of the hundreds of thousands of hacked servers around the world are likely to be actively targeted by the Chinese hackers, says Volexity founder Steven Adair. The Hafnium Exchange hacking campaign now represents the second hacking campaign of that scale, just a few months later. The Chinese hackers Exchange exploitation spree appears to have begun only months ago, in contrast to the Russia's silent, year-plus SolarWinds espionage campaign. As daunting as the task of cleaning up the hackers' tens of thousands of infections may be, that early detection may give victims a chance to both patch their systems and remove the hackers before they can take advantage of their foothold inside organizations.
