Ten years ago we raised awareness of Ebury by publishing a white paper we called Operation Windigo, which documented a campaign that leveraged Linux malware for financial gain. Today we publish a follow-up paper on how Ebury has evolved, and the new malware families its operators use to monetize their botnet of Linux servers. The gang leverages its access to the hosting provider's infrastructure to install Ebury on all the servers that are being rented by that provider. As an experiment, we rented a virtual server from one of the compromised hosting providers: Ebury was installed on our server within seven days. Ebury operators leverage existing Ebury-compromised servers in the same network segment as their target to perform ARP spoofing. So how effective are all these methods? Combined, about 400,000 servers have been compromised by Ebury since 2009, and more than 100,000 were still compromised as of late 2023. The new paper, Ebury is alive but unseen: 400k Linux servers compromised for cryptocurrency theft and financial gain, goes into more details about each of Ebury's aspects, including many technical specifics.
