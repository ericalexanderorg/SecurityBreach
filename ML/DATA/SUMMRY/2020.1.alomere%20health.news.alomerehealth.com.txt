Alomere Health understands the importance of protecting our patients' information. On January 3, 2020, we began notifying some of our patients of an email incident that may involve portions of their information. In an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments in the accounts to identify patients whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person(s). This information may have included patients' names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, health insurance information, treatment information, and/or diagnosis information. For a limited number of patients, Social Security number and/or driver's license numbers were also found in the accounts. Even though we have no confirmation that patient information was actually viewed by the unauthorized person(s), or that it has been misused, we mailed letters to patients whose information was found in the accounts. Patients with questions can call 1-844-907-1662, Monday through Friday, between 8:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Central Time.
