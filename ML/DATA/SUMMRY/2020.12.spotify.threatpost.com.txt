Spotify has alerted users that some of their registration data was inadvertently exposed to a third-party business partner, including emails addresses, preferred display names, passwords, gender and dates of birth. "A very small subset of Spotify users was impacted by a software bug, which has now been fixed and addressed." A statement from a Spotify spokesperson to Threatpost read. "Protecting our users' privacy and maintaining their trust are top priorities at Spotify. To address this issue, we issued a password reset to impacted users. We take these obligations extremely seriously." The company urges users to update passwords for other accounts tied to the same email account. "If you detect any suspicious activity on your Spotify account, you should promptly notify us." "Brute-force, cracking tools and account checkers are the cornerstones of many account takeover operations, reliably enabling attackers to get their hands on even more of your data." Clark explained to Threatpost. "Criminal operations using brute-force cracking tools or account checkers may also take advantage of IP addresses, VPN services, botnets or proxies to maintain anonymity or improve the likelihood of accessing an account," Clark added. "Once they're in, they can use the account for malicious purposes or extract all of its data to monetize it."
