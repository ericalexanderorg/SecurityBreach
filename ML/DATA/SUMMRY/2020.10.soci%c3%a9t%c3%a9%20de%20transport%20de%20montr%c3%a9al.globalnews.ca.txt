The Société de transport de Montréal says it still can't confirm the origin of the computer virus that knocked down its network on Oct. 19. In a statement released Tuesday, the public transit agency said a cybersecurity investigation is still underway and its IT teams are working to restore the network. Around 1,000 of the STM's 1,600 servers were affected by the outage. The agency says 50 per cent of the affected servers have been restored.
