Swiss-based global shipping giant Mediterranean Shipping Company has confirmed that a recent outage was caused by a malware attack that affected its headquarters in Geneva. MSC informed customers on April 10 that its website, msc.com, and its myMSC customer and vendor portal had become unavailable due to a network outage at one of the company's data centers. MSC said at the time that it did not entirely rule out the possibility that the incident was caused by a piece of malware, but provided no further information. "After a thorough investigation, we confirmed that it was confined to a limited number of physical computer systems in Geneva only and we determined that it was a malware attack based on an engineered targeted vulnerability. We have shared as per industry standards the malware with our technology partners so that mitigations could be made available not only to us," MSC said. MSC said the attack had a limited impact on its business, and it has found no evidence that any data has been compromised or lost as a result of the incident. "During the network outage, MSC's global agencies and our people around the world continued to serve customers as usual in most cases. All MSC departments, terminals, depots etc. operated without disruptions and the incident posed no threat to parties engaging in business with the company," MSC stated. MSC is not the only major shipping company hit by malware in recent years.
