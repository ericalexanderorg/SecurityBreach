Norway's parliament said Tuesday it had been the target of a "Vast" cyber attack that enabled hackers to access the emails of some lawmakers. The hackers' identities were not immediately known. "The parliament has recently been targetted in a vast cyber attack," the institution wrote in a statement. The website of the Storting, the single chamber parliament, was working normally on Tuesday. The parliament's administrative director said the institution had detected "Anomalies a little more than a week ago" and took steps "That were effective". In its annual threat assessment published in February, Norway's domestic intelligence service PST warned of "Computer network operations" which they said represented a "Persistent and long-term threat to Norway". In 2018, Norway arrested a Russian national suspected of gathering information on the parliament's internet network, but released him several weeks later due to lack of evidence.
