CATAWBA COUNTY, NC - In Catawba County, letters are going out to more than 9,000 county employees, family members, and some retirees regarding a computer hack. Emails were sent to all county employees at that time to be on the lookout for identity theft issues. The county has sent out letters to 9,400 people advising them to be on the lookout for any issues that may come up. So far there is no evidence that any compromised information has been used by whoever hacked the system. They believe the hackers got into the system by sending emails to county employees and when someone opened up one of those emails, malware got into the system. Assistant County Manager Mary Furtado, who is among the 187 who had information stolen, is urging everyone to be vigilant against cyber thieves. County officials say the cyber breach has already cost the county $50,000 in deductible fees to the insurance company who is helping to pay for the experts who examined the system and for new cybersecurity efforts to shore up the computer system against hackers.
