Argentina's official immigration agency, Dirección Nacional de Migraciones, suffered a Netwalker ransomware attack that temporarily halted border crossing into and out of the country. While ransomware attacks against cities and local agencies have become all too common, this may be a first known attack against a federal agency that has interrupted a country's operations. According to a criminal complaint published by Argentina's cybercrime agency, Unidad Fiscal Especializada en Ciberdelincuencia, the government first learned of the ransomware attack after receiving numerous tech support calls from checkpoints at approximately 7 AM on August 27th. "Being approximately 7 a.m. of the day indicated in the paragraph above, the Directorate of Technology and Communications under the Directorate General Information Systems and Technologies of this Organization received numerous calls from various checkpoints requesting technical support." To prevent the ransomware from infecting further devices, the computer networks used by the immigration offices and control posts were shut down. When the Netwalker performs a ransomware attack, ransom notes will be left on devices that have been encrypted. From a Netwalker Tor payment page shared with BleepingComputer, we have learned that the ransomware actors initially demanded a $2 million ransom. After seven days passed, the ransom increased to $4 million, or approximately 355 bitcoins, as shown below in the image of Dirección Nacional de Migraciones's ransom page.
