Attackers are taking no breaks and actually pull harder before holidays, as shown by a San Antonio mental health services provider and a New Mexico hospital impacted by malware attacks according to reports and disclosures published before Christmas. San Antonio's The Center for Health Care Services shut down computing systems for all its clinics in response to a larger-scale cyber-attack that took place last week. The CHSC provides various mental health services to adults and children with "Mental health conditions, substance use challenges and intellectual or developmental disabilities" from San Antonio, Texas. The server has been secured and patient information has been restored. Health and Human Services was notified within the 60-day reporting timeframe." Colorado Department of Human Services, Sinai Health System, Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, Children's Hope Alliance, and RiverKids Pediatric Home Health are a handful of the total number of healthcare providers impacted by data breaches just during December. Just in these five incidents, the protected health information of tens of thousands of individuals was exposed per reports filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. As proof of how easy it easy to infiltrate and/or hack into health industry entities' systems, using the ?amerka Internet of Things/Industrial Control Systems reconnaissance tool one can easily get an interactive map of exposed healthcare devices.
