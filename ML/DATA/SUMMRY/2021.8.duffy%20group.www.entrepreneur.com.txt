In the United States, a cyberattack occurs every 39 seconds, according to Security Magazine. In March, I was notified by our IT company that the FBI had released information of a potential serious vulnerability in our email server. Cyberattacks on small and mid-sized businesses have been driven largely by Covid, when work-from-home employees gained remote access to their company's servers via tools that make email and other systems vulnerable. I quickly learned IT security is a lose-lose game: The hacker has the upper hand, so it's best to cooperate, negotiate and do whatever possible to get your systems up and running. Be warned: Although hackers are in the lucrative business of collecting money for returning what is rightfully yours, they work on their own schedules and thus can be slow to respond. Time zones can hamper your company's return to normalcy too, as many of these hackers are overseas. Investigate the tools, including a backup computer system, to protect your system.
