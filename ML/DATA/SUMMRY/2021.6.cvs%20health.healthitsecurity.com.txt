June 21, 2021 - More than 1 billion CVS Health search records were accidentally posted online in a data breach incident in late March by an unnamed third party vendor. The records contained search data from CVS.com and CVSHealth.com for both COVID-19 vaccines and medications. In most cases, the search data could not be linked to a specific person, Fowler told Forbes. "In March of this year, a security researcher notified us of a publicly accessible database that contained non-identifiable CVS Health metadata. We immediately investigated and determined that the database, which was hosted by a third party vendor, did not contain any personal information of our customers, members or patients," said CVS Health in a public statement. Even if no personal data was collected, a breach of this size can present legitimate risks to large organizations like CVS who track search data for analytics, marketing, and customer engagement purposes. Because of this, it is unclear exactly how many CVS customers were impacted by the data breach. In other data breach news, recent employee reports reveal that a May 31st cyberattack on the University of Florida Health Leesburg Hospital and The Villages Regional Hospital is now negatively impacting patient care.
