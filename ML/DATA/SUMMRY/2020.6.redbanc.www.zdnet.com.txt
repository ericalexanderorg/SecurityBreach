A Skype call and a gullible employee was all it took for North Korean hackers to infiltrate the computer network of Redbanc, the company that interconnects the ATM infrastructure of all Chilean banks. Prime suspects behind the hack are a hacker group known as Lazarus Group, known to have associations to the Pyongyang regime, is one of the most active and dangerous hacking groups around, and known to have targeted banks, financial institutions, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the past years. According to reporters, the source of the hack was identified as a LinkedIn ad for a developer position at another company to which one of the Redbanc employees applied. The hiring company, believed to be a front for the Lazarus Group operators who realized they baited a big fish, approached the Redbanc employee for an interview, which they conducted in Spanish via a Skype call. The collected information would have been able to tell the hackers what computer they infected, and later decide if they'd want to deliver a second stage payload in the form of a more intrusive PowerShell script. The Redbanc incident is yet another example of how one worker clicking on the wrong link or running the wrong file can result in a major security breach, and how one hacked PC or laptop can lead to an entire network getting compromised. Previously, according to an indictment by US authorities, Lazarus Group hackers have been accused of attempting to steal money from Banco de Chile, a local Chilean bank.
