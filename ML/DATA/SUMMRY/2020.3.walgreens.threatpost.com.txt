Popular pharmacy chain Walgreens is warning that a bug in its official mobile app may have exposed sensitive data, including customers' full names and information on prescriptions for medications they are taking. While Walgreens did not detail the technical glitch, it said that the internal application error enabled certain personal messages, stored in a database, to be viewed by other customers who were using the mobile app. "As part of our investigation, Walgreens determined that certain messages containing limited health-related information were involved in this incident for a small percentage of impacted customers," according to a Walgreens data security incident customer notification, filed with the Office of the Attorney General and published Friday. "We believe that you were part of the impacted customer group and that one or more personal messages containing your limited health-related information may have been viewed by another customer on the Walgreens mobile app between January 9, 2020 and January 15, 2020.". After the issue was discovered on Jan. 15, "Walgreens promptly took steps to disable the message viewing feature within the Walgreens mobile app to prevent further disclosure until a permanent correction was implemented to resolve the issue," according to the notice. The Walgreens mobile app on the Google Play app marketplace has more than 10 million downloads. In 2013, the company was hit with a $1.4 million penalty for a data breach after a pharmacist in a Walgreens store in Indianapolis inappropriately viewed and shared a woman's prescription history.
