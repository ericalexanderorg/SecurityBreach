Mitsubishi Electric, a leading global company in the manufacture and sales of electrical and electronic products, disclosed a security breach that might have caused the leak of personal and confidential corporate information. Mitsubishi Electric is still continuing internal investigations into unauthorized access to its network according to a Japanese security blogger. The breach began with affiliates in China and then spread to the company's internal network per an Asahi Shimbun report that prompted Mitsubishi Electric's statement. Mitsubishi Electric said that it wasn't possible to know for sure if the information might have been exfiltrated by the attackers from some of the compromised terminals since the logs were deleted to erase traces. An in-house investigation confirmed "That sensitive information on social infrastructure such as defense, electric power, and railways, highly confidential technical information, and important information concerning business partners did not leak." Local media also says that Japanese authorities were also notified, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshii Suga confirming after the Cabinet meeting on the morning of January 20 that he "Was notified that it was confirmed that there was no leak of sensitive information such as defense equipment and electric power." Mitsubishi Electric will start delivering notifications and reports on the breach to customers who might have had their information leaked during the incident.
