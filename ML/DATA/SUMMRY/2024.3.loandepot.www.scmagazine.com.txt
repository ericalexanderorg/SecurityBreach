Major U.S. mortgage lender loanDepot notified nearly 17 million customers that their data, including Social Security numbers, may have been stolen in a cyberattack in January. The compromised data included names, addresses, email addresses, financial account numbers, Social Security numbers, phone numbers and dates of birth, according to a sample notification letter provided by loanDepot to the Maine attorney general. ALPHV/BlackCat claims responsibility for loanDepot breach. The loanDepot breach was claimed by ransomware gang ALPHV/BlackCat on Feb. 16, which also claimed a ransomware attack against Prudential Financial on the same day. ALPHV/BlackCat claimed negotiations with loanDepot included a proposed $6 million ransom payment, although claims made by the criminal group should not be taken at face value, The Register reported. "This breach at LoanDepot is a stark reminder of the far-reaching consequences of ransomware attacks. It's concerning to see the scale and sensitivity of the data involved, particularly the inclusion of Social Security numbers, which opens up a Pandora's box of identity theft and financial fraud possibilities," Javvad Malik, lead security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, told SC Media in an email. The latest breach notification increases the tally of affected loanDepot customers from the 16.6 million reported on Jan. 22 to more than 16.9 million.
