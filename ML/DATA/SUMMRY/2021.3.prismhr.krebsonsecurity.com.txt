Countless small businesses turn to PEOs in part because they simplify compliance with various state payroll taxes, and because PEOs are the easiest way for small businesses to pool their resources and obtain more favorable health insurance rates for their employees. Jacob Cloran is co-founder of Decimal, a company that does accounting for small businesses, many of whom rely on PEOs affected by the PrismHR outage. Decimal itself uses a PEO that relies on PrismHR. "We don't have a good option to run our payroll this week, and the message we've received from our PEO doesn't give me a lot of confidence we'll be able to do that," Cloran said. Cloran said while there are other cloud-based companies that work with multiple PEOs, PrismHR is by far the largest. A notice from the PEO working with some of Cloran's clients stated that PrismHR was in the process of rebuilding its entire system from data backups in a new environment. PrismHR said in a statement to its PEO customers that while its investigation and response to the incident is ongoing, the company "Is not aware of any sensitive data being breached or compromised." Given the volume and sensitive nature of the data PrismHR managed on behalf of PEO clients, it's no doubt those clients and their customers are hoping that statement is accurate as well.
