The United Nations has suffered a data breach that exposed the details of more than 100,000 U.N. Environmental Program employees, but in a twist, the breach was uncovered by ethical hackers. The data breach involved exposed Git directories and Git credential files on domains associated with the UNEP and the U.N.'s International Labor Organization. According to Bleeping Computer, Sakura Samurai reported the vulnerability to the U.N. Jan. 4 and was met was a response that the issue did not pertain to the U.N. Secretariat or the U.N. ILO. Eventually, the U.N. did actually pick up the fact that they were leaking data with Saiful Ridwan, chief of enterprise solutions at UNEP, eventually thanking Sakura Samurai for letting them know. In what could generously be described as a clown show, the UNEP told Bleeping Computer that dealing with the data breach disclosure was "Challenging as we have not done this before." It's not known with any certainty whether the data had been accessed by bad actors, but Sakura Samuari noted that it's highly likely that the data had been accessed and stolen before it was discovered. "Ethical Hacking group Sakura Samurai's exposure of the United Nations Environment Program's git repositories is another classic example of the consequences of an unintentional misconfiguration," Saryu Nayyar, chief executive officer of unified security and risk analytics company Gurucul Solutions Pvt Ltd. A.G., told SiliconANGLE. "Fortunately, the U.N.'s IT team reacted quickly to close the hole, but it is likely that threat actors had already discovered the vulnerable data and acquired it themselves."
