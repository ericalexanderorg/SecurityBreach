Cloud communications company Twilio says some of its customers' data was accessed by attackers who breached internal systems after stealing employee credentials in an SMS phishing attack. "On August 4, 2022, Twilio became aware of unauthorized access to information related to a limited number of Twilio customer accounts through a sophisticated social engineering attack designed to steal employee credentials," Twilio said over the weekend. The company also revealed the attackers gained access to its systems after tricking and stealing credentials from multiple employees targeted in the phishing incident. The SMS phishing messages baited Twilio's employees into clicking the embedded links by warning them that their passwords had expired or were scheduled to be changed. Twilio's EMEA Communications Director Katherine James declined to provide more information when asked how many employees had their accounts compromised in the phishing attack and how many customers were affected by the breach, saying the company has "No additional comment to provide at this time beyond what is posted in the blog." Twilio revoked the employee accounts compromised during the attack to block the attackers' access to its systems and has started notifying customers affected by this incident.
