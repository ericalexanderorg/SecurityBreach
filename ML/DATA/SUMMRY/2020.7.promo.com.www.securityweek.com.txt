Video creation service Promo.com this week confirmed that user data was exposed as a result of a data breach identified last week. Founded in 2012, Israel-based Promo was initially a slideshow company named Slidely. In 2016, it launched the Promo video creation platform for businesses and in 2019 it rebranded from Slidely to Promo.com. Both Slidely and Promo user data was impacted in the incident, but no financial information was leaked, Promo says. Although no financial data, such as credit card and billing information, was affected in the breach, lots of other user information was exposed, including first and last names, gender, email and IP addresses, approximated user location, and encrypted, hashed and salted passwords for the Promo and Slidely accounts. Promo urges users to change their Promo or Slidely passwords when next logging into their accounts. The company did not share information on how many users were impacted in the incident, but risk management provider CloudSEK revealed that the information of 22.1 million Promo users was offered for sale last week.
