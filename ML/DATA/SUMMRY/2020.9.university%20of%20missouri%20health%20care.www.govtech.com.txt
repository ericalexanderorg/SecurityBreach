An investigation into the May cyberattack against University of Missouri Health Care indicates that sensitive personal information - including Social Security numbers - of some patients was compromised. University of Missouri Health Care reported Friday that it has been working to determine the damage from a data breach that occurred between May 4 and May 6. In a news release, MU Health wrote that on Aug. 28 it completed the process and found that the stolen information could include names, birth dates, account numbers, health insurance information, and, for some patients, a Social Security number and/or driver's license number. MU Health Care has notified patients with potentially stolen information and is providing credit monitoring to those people at no cost. "MU Health Care also recommends patients review any statements they receive from their health insurers or health care providers," the release stated. MU Health Care has established a dedicated call center to answer any questions individuals may have about the incident. Additional information is posted on the MU Health Care website, muhealth.org/data-security-incident.
