Twitter today finally decided to temporarily disable a feature, called 'Tweeting via SMS,' after it was abused by a hacking group to compromise Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey last week and sent a series of racist and offensive tweets to Dorsey's followers. Dorsey's Twitter account was compromised last week when a hacker group calling itself "Chuckling Squad" replicated a mobile phone number associated with the CEO account and abused this particular feature to post racist, offensive messages and bomb threats from it via SMS. Replicating a mobile phone number associated with someone else is a technique known as "SIM swapping," where attackers social engineer a victim's mobile phone provider and trick the telecom company to transfer target's phone number to their own SIM card. Once they social engineered an AT&T employee and gained access to Dorsey's phone number, the Chuckling Squad hackers used the 'Tweeting via SMS' feature to post tweets under his username, even without actually logging in to his account. For those unaware, Twitter has a feature that gives its users the ability to post a tweet from their account just by sending an SMS message to the company number from their registered mobile number associated with their Twitter account. Twitter says the phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider, allowing an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number pic. The feature still exists and has been misused several times in the past since no authentication is required other than just having access to the linked phone number. In a series of tweets published today, Twitter says it has temporarily disabled this feature and working on improving it by exploring options to offer an authenticated way.
