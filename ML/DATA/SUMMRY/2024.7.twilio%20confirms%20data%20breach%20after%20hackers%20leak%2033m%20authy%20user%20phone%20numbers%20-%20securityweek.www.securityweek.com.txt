Twilio this week confirmed suffering a data breach after hackers leaked 33 million phone numbers associated with the Authy application. The notorious ShinyHunters hackers announced on the relaunched BreachForums website in late June that they were leaking 33 million random phone numbers associated with Twilio's two-factor authentication app Authy. The leaked information also included account IDs and some other non-personal data associated with Authy users. In a security alert posted on its website, Twilio confirmed the data breach. "Twilio has detected that threat actors were able to identify data associated with Authy accounts, including phone numbers, due to an unauthenticated endpoint. We have taken action to secure this endpoint and no longer allow unauthenticated requests," the company said. Twilio found no evidence that the hackers gained access to its systems or that they obtained other sensitive data, but as a precaution urged Authy users to install the latest Android and iOS security updates. "While Authy accounts are not compromised, threat actors may try to use the phone number associated with Authy accounts for phishing and smishing attacks; we encourage all Authy users to stay diligent and have heightened awareness around the texts they are receiving," Twilio said.
