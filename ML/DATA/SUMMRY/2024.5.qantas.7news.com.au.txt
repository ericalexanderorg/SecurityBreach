Qantas customers have reported a data breach with the national carrier's app that allows travellers to access a stranger's booking information. After logging into the Qantas app, customers were being presented with the wrong account details, including the person's boarding pass, points score and status tier. A second person said: "I was able to access full booking details, including the ability to cancel someone's flight to Europe." Another Qantas customer reported seeing a different account each time they opened the app. "We sincerely apologise to customers impacted by the issue with the Qantas app this morning, which has now been resolved," a spokesperson said. "The issue was isolated to the Qantas app with some frequent flyers able to see the travel information of other customers, including name, upcoming flight details, points balance and status."No further personal or financial information was shared and customers would not have been able to transfer or use the Qantas Points of other frequent flyers. We're not aware of any customers travelling with incorrect boarding passes.
