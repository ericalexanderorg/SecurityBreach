St. Clair County government officials said they believe no data was allowed to leave the county's computer system following a cyber attack Monday night. According to a statement released by County Attorney Jim Hill, the attack happened around 7 p.m. County employees immediately took action to keep hardware and software from being compromised any further. At the same time, authorities are trying to find out where the attack came from. The county would not comment on the nature of the attack. In a ransomware attack, hackers deliver a file to unsuspecting users that once downloaded is used to commandeer and lockup a network. Several Alabama cities have fallen victim to cyber attacks recently. Around 70 computers in Chilton County were hit back in July by a ransomware attack that forced a two-week closure of services at the county's tag and probate offices.
