LockBit ransomware operators have compromised the systems at the helicopter maker Kopter and published them on their darkweb leak site. The helicopter maker Kopter was hit by LockBit ransomware, the attackers compromised its internal network and encrypted the company's files. After Kopter refused to pay the ransom, LockBit ransomware operators published the stolen files on their leak site on the dark web. The files published by the ransomware gang on the leak site include internal projects, business documents, and various aerospace and defense industry standards. LockBit ransomware operators told ZDNet that they have accessed the network of the helicopter maker via a VPN appliance that was poorly protected. "In an email, the operators of the LockBit ransomware told ZDNet that they breached Kopter's network last week by exploiting a VPN appliance that used a weak password and did not have two-factor authentication enabled." reported ZDNet. At the time of this writing, Kopter has yet to publicly disclose the ransomware infection.
