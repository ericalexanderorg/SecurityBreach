Rather than the sophisticated monitoring of many similarly insecure competitors it simply asks for permission to record the targeted device on infection. Afterward the observer can log in to an online portal and activate recording, at which point a screen capture is taken on the device and played on the target's browser. The API key seems to serve as our account ID. Once the account is made, we are given a link to an APK to install on the target device. We can log into the dashboard in the browser and see our devices. For each device, a thumbnail of a device screenshot is displayed. If we know the address of one screenshot for a device, we can reasonably poke around neighbouring timestamps to find the rest of the capture. If we could get this for a device, we could easily get the rest of the capture! Unfortunately it seems to be protected in two ways: the URL contains the API Key, and there's a token.
