The Transparent Tribe cyber-espionage group continues to improve its arsenal while targets Military and Government entities. The Transparent Tribe APT group is carrying out an ongoing cyberespionage campaign aimed at military and diplomatic targets worldwide. The Operation Transparent Tribe was first spotted by Proofpoint Researchers in Feb 2016, in a series of cyber espionage operations against Indian diplomats and military personnel in some embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. Transparent Tribe has been active since at least 2013, it targeted entities across 27 countries, most of them in Afghanistan, Germany, India, Iran and Pakistan. The threat actor remained under the radar for a long period, in January Cybaze ZLab researchers gathered evidence on the return of Operation Transparent Tribe after 4 years of silence. Transparent Tribe has also implemented Crimson RAT a new USBWorm component used to steal files from removable drives, spreading across systems by infecting removable media, and downloading and executing a thin-client version of Crimson from a remote server. "Transparent Tribe continues to show high activity against multiple targets. In the last twelve months, we observed a broad campaign against military and diplomatic targets, using extensive infrastructure to support their operations and continuous improvements in their arsenal." concludes Kaspersky.
