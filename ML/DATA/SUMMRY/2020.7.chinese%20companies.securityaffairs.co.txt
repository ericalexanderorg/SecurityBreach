Researchers at Cybernews uncovered two unsecured databases, with millions of records, belonging to Chinese companies. Our research uncovered two unsecured databases, with millions of records, belonging to companies that are based in China and provide different types of services. One database belongs to Xiaoxintong, which offers multiple apps and services aimed at elderly care. The database for Xiaoxintong, which serves more than 200 million elderly people in China, contains sensitive information such as GPS locations, mobile numbers, addresses, hashed passwords and more. The second database that may be from Shanghai Yanhua Smartech has even more sensitive data, such as easily-decoded audio files, names, employee ID numbers, heart rates, oxygen levels, GPS locations and more. Each database contains particularly sensitive information. While we're fairly confident that the first Chinese database belongs to Xiaoxintong, we haven't fully confirmed that the second database belongs to Shanghai Yanhua Smartech.
