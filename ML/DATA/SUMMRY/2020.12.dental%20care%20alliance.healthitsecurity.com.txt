The potentially compromised data could include patient names, contact details, dental diagnoses, treatment information, patient account numbers, billing details, dentists' names, bank account numbers, and health insurance data. More than two months after falling victim to a ransomware attack, Sonoma Valley Hospital is notifying 67,000 patients that their data was likely compromised during the incident. Officials later confirmed that a small subset of data was likely exfiltrated during the attack, and later, about 75GB of data allegedly stolen from Sonoma Valley was posted on a dark web posting of Mount Locker ransomware actors. The latest update shows Sonoma Valley is still working to fully restore its network, more than two months after hackers dropped the ransomware payload. The investigation has determined the impacted patient data affected by the event involved health claims data sent electronically to insurers, such as names, contact details, birthdates, insurer group and subscriber numbers, diagnoses, procedure codes, dates and place of service, claim amounts, and secondary payer information. Conti threat actors, which have notoriously hacked nonprofit and mental health providers without scruples, leaked data they claim to have stolen from WWAARC. Data extortion is no longer a rare incidence, with Coveware research finding extortion occurs in half of ransomware incidents. As a result, 109,000 files that included lab test results, medical records, provider notes, insurance claims, and other data from US patients were left unencrypted and exposed online. As a result, 1.7TB of business-related data was left exposed online, such as pharmaceutical sales data, full names of Apodis Pharma partners and employees, client warehouse stock stats, shipment locations, contact details, and a host of other sensitive data.
