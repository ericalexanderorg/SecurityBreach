Photo-print service Chatbooks has confirmed a data breach, a week after cybercriminals listed a database containing customer email addresses, passwords and more for sale on an underground forum. "We are currently working with a digital security and forensics firm to assess the extent of this data security breach," said Quigley in a data breach notice this week. On May 7, ZeroFox researchers reported that the Shiny Hunters hacking group was selling the Chatbooks customer database on underground forums, along with records from meal kit delivery service HomeChef and Chronicle.com. The Shiny Hunters group have made a mark on underground forums, already allegedly compromising 73.2 million user records from over 11 companies worldwide. Researchers earlier this month also observed Shiny Hunters stealing log-in data for 91 millions users of Indonesia's largest e-commerce platform, Tokopedia, and then selling it on the dark web for $5,000. Researchers with ZeroFox noted that the Shiny Hunters hacking group appears to be taking a page out of the book of GnosticPlayers, the breach data broker who stole billions of records from dozens of companies between 2018 and 2019 and sold them online. "Due to the verification of the Tokopedia breach by multiple researchers and the company itself, ZeroFOX Alpha Team has high confidence that these new breaches are legitimate, and will most likely be available on other breach marketplaces at lower prices in the near future," said researchers.
