The hackers behind the biggest data breaches of the past year have reportedly struck again in a two-fold attack against American Airlines Group Inc. and flight reservation management giant Sabre Corp. that may have compromised millions of people. The Chinese hackers believed responsible for the attack are suspected of having previously stolen medical records and other sensitive personal data belonging to some 80 millions Americans from Anthem Inc., according to sources close to the investigations cited in the Bloomberg report that broke the news. Similar techniques were also used in an earlier hack against hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc. that claimed a more modest but still substantial 4.5 million records. The missing link between the seemingly disparate attacks of the Chinese group is their infiltration into the networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The sources who tipped off Bloomberg to the attacks against American Airlines and Sabre therefore believe that their motivation lied in the fact that the healthcare giant handles insurance claims for several federal branches including the Defense Department's Defense Health Agency. In the likelihood that the hackers managed to get what they were looking for, that means they now not only know the personal, professional and medical histories of millions of government workers with security clearances but also where they traveled.
