Cyber-criminals who launched a ransomware attack on a US court have published what they claim are stolen court documents online. Attackers claim to have successfully targeted the Fourth Judicial District Court of Louisiana with a ransomware strain known as Conti, first detected in the wild in December 2019. Alleged proof of the attack was published on the dark web this week. Ransomware attacks are nothing new in the Pelican State. A month earlier, a major ransomware attack on Louisiana state IT infrastructure forced multiple services offline, including government websites, email, and internal applications. In July of 2019, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency after ransomware attacks knocked out IT systems in three school districts. Mulling over how the attack may have unfolded, Schless added: "An advanced hacking group like the one behind Conti would likely use social engineering to convince a target employee to download a document or file to their device."
