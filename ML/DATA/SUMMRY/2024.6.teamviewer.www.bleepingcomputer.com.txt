The remote access software company TeamViewer is warning that its corporate environment was breached in a cyberattack yesterday, with a cybersecurity firm claiming it was by an APT hacking group. "On Wednesday, 26 June 2024, our security team detected an irregularity in TeamViewer's internal corporate IT environment," TeamViewer said in a post to its Trust Center. "TeamViewer's internal corporate IT environment is completely independent from the product environment. There is no evidence to suggest that the product environment or customer data is affected. Investigations are ongoing and our primary focus remains to ensure the integrity of our systems." While TeamViewer states there is no evidence that its product environment or customer data has been breached, its massive use in both consumer and corporate environments makes any breach a significant concern as it would provide full access to internal networks. "The NCC Group Global Threat Intelligence team has been made aware of significant compromise of the TeamViewer remote access and support platform by an APT group," warns an alert from the IT security firm NCC Group. An alert from Health-ISAC, a community for healthcare professionals to share threat intelligence, also warned today that TeamViewer services were allegedly being actively targeted by the Russian hacking group APT29, also known as Cozy Bear, NOBELIUM, and Midnight Blizzard. While the alerts from both companies come today, just as TeamViewer disclosed the incident, it is unclear if they are linked as TeamViewer's and NCC's alerts address the corporate breach, while the Health-ISAC alert focuses more on targeting TeamViewer connections.
