Hackers associated with the "Fullz House" group have compromised the website of Boom! Mobile and planted a web skimmer, Malwarebytes reports. Initially detailed in November 2019, Fullz House has been active for over a year, focused either on phishing for personally identifiable information, banking credentials, and banking card data, or on skimming or phishing card data from ecommerce sites. The attack on Boom! Mobile, Malwarebytes reveals, involved the injection of one line of code containing a Base64 encoded URL designed to load a JavaScript library from a remote domain used in a previous attack. The injected URL, Malwarebytes' security researchers say, loads a fake Google Analytics script which is nothing more than a credit card skimmer designed to find specific input fields and exfiltrate data from those fields. "This skimmer is quite noisy as it will exfiltrate data every time it detects a change in the fields displayed on the current page. From a network traffic point of view, you can see each leak as a single GET request where the data is Base64 encoded," the researchers explain. Boom! Mobile's website is running PHP version 5.6.40 and this, or a vulnerable plugin, might have been the point of entry, Malwarebytes notes. The security firm also says that it reported the incident to the wireless services provider both via live chat and email, but hasn't heard back and the compromise hasn't been addressed yet, meaning that Boom! Mobile customers continue to be at risk.
