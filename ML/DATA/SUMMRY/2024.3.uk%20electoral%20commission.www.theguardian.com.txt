Chinese state-backed hackers were responsible for two malicious digital campaigns targeting the UK's democratic institutions and politicians, the security services have found. The UK holds China responsible for a prolonged cyber-attack on the Electoral Commission during which Beijing allegedly accessed the personal details of about 40 million voters. The National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ, also found that four British parliamentarians who have been critical of Beijing were targeted in a separate attack, although the activity was identified before any systems were compromised. Two individuals and a front company linked to the Chinese state sponsored cyber-group APT31, which is linked to Chinese ministry of state security and is believed to have been behind the hack, have been hit with sanctions by the UK as a result. This included setting up the Defending Democracy Taskforce and bringing in the National Security Act 2023, giving the security services and law enforcement agencies more powers to disrupt hostile activity. The head of an international group of parliamentarians focusing on China said the UK government had been too slow to respond to cyber-attacks, especially given that the Electoral Commission hack was first detected in 2022. David Cameron, the foreign secretary, has raised the cyber-attacks on Britain's democratic institutions directly with the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi. "It is completely unacceptable that China state-affiliated organisations and individuals have targeted our democratic institutions and political processes. While these attempts to interfere with UK democracy have not been successful, we will remain vigilant and resilient to the threats we face," Cameron said.
