Snake Ransomware operators launched a new campaign that has infected numerous companies worldwide including an health care organization. The operators behind the Snake Ransomware have launched a new campaign that targeted companies worldwide and that infected at least one organization in the healthcare industry over the last few days. In January experts observed a new wave of attacks that targeted organizations worldwide, experts from SentinelOne also discovered Snake Ransomware that was targeting processes and files associated with industrial control systems. The spike in the attack associated with this specific threat is confirmed by data shared by the ransomware identification site ID Ransomware that demonstrates a massive jump in submissions to the service. Snake Ransomware is suspected to have been employed in a ransomware attack that hit Fresenius Group, Europe's largest hospital provider. "Fresenius, Europe's largest private hospital operator and a major provider of dialysis products and services that are in such high demand thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been hit in a ransomware cyber attack on its technology systems. The company said the incident has limited some of its operations, but that patient care continues," reported the popular investigator Brian Krebs. According to Krebs, this isn't the first ransomware attack suffered by Fresenius, the company already paid $1.5 million to resume operations after a previous ransomware infection.
