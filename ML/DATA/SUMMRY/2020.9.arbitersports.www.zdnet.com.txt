A company that provides software for sports leagues to manage referees and game officials has disclosed a security incident that impacted around 540,000 of its registered members - consisting of referees, league officials, and school representatives. ArbiterSports, the official software provider for the NCAA and many other leagues, said it fended off a ransomware attack in July this year. In a data breach notification letter filed with multiple states across the US [1, 2], the company said that despite detecting and blocking the hackers from encrypting its files, the intruders managed to steal a copy of its backups. This backup contained data from ArbiterGame, ArbiterOne, and ArbiterWorks - three of the web applications used by schools and sports leagues to assign and manage the schedules and training programs of referees and game officials. There is no guarantee that the hackers haven't made a copy of the data before deleting ArbiterSport's data. Sources in the incident response community have told ZDNet about cases where ransomware gangs did not delete the data. The ArbiterSports incident is reminiscent of a similar incident disclosed by Blackbaud, a provider of cloud-based software to universities and non-profits.
