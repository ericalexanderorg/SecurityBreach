A hacker is sharing what they state are 3.2 million Pluto TV user records that were stolen during a data breach. Pluto TV is an Internet television service that lets you stream free TV shows with advertisements. Over the past week, threat actors have been releasing user databases for farious commercial websites that were stolen during data breaches on a hacker forum. On Wednesday, a threat actor shared what they say is a Pluto TV user database containing 3.2 million user records. In a statement to BleepingComputer Pluto TV has not confirmed if the data breach occurred, and only that they are investigating. Out of an abundance of caution, it is suggested that all Pluto TV users immediately change their passwords. If you use the same Pluto TV password at other sites, it is strongly recommended that you change them there as well.
