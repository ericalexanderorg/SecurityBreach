After one day of classes, the Somerset Hills School District closed down the schools on Tuesday because it said there was an "Unexpected network disruption." In a letter to the school community, the superintendent said the district's computer network would need to be offline for 48 hours, forcing classes for Bernardsville Middle School and Bedwell Elementary students to go virtual on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday, Superintendent Gretchen Dempsey said in another letter that ransonware was the culprit. "Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the district's network had been the target of a cyber incident; ransomware was used sometime after Friday, September 3 to encrypt a very limited portion of the network," Dempsey said. Dempsey said the district hired "Industry-leading forensic experts to contain the incident and ensure that the network could be restored to full operability safely." A full virtual schedule will continue through Monday, Sept. 14 for all students, she said, at which time they "Hope" to have the district's network repaired. Separately, Dempsey said the number of COVID-19 cases "Within our school community" continues to grow.
