23andMe, a genetic testing company, recently disclosed a significant data breach. In a notification letter to regulators, they revealed that hackers infiltrated customer accounts from April 2023 to September 2023. Shockingly, 23andMe failed to detect these cyberattacks for approximately five months. During this period, hackers successfully accessed the accounts of around 14,000 customers by brute-forcing passwords that were already publicly available. The stolen data included ancestry and genetic information from 6.9 million users, which accounts for about half of 23andMe’s customer base. The breach came to light when hackers advertised the stolen data on unofficial 23andMe forums and other hacking platforms. Subsequently, victims filed class action lawsuits against 23andMe in the U.S. and Canada. The company’s attempt to change its terms of service to hinder collective legal action was met with criticism from data breach lawyers12.
