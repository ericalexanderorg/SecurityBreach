The UK Data Protection Regulator has issued a monetary penalty of £500,000 against Dixon Carphone for what it describes as "Multiple, systemic and serious inadequacies" in the firm's security posture. The £500,000 penalty is the maximum allowed under the UK's earlier DPA 1998; and the ICO made it clear it would have been considerably higher under GDPR. The breach, which was notified to Dixons by external sources, involved malware running on 5,390 point of sale terminals, involving 5,646,417 payment cards, of which all but 52,788 were EMV chip protected cards. This allowed Dixons to argue that the PAN was not personal data, and that this aspect of the breach was consequently not subject to the personal data focus of the data protection laws. Interestingly, Dixons had a security assessment before the breach. While the ICO made it clear that compliance or non-compliance with PCI DSS is not indicative of compliance or non-compliance with the DPA, the office had earlier made it clear in guidelines that it would "Consider the extent to which you have put in place measures that PCI-DSS requires particularly if the breach related to a lack of particular control or process mandated by the standard." Dixons was clearly found wanting. Dixons separately argued that the quantitively larger part of the breach should be treated leniently because there was no evidence of widespread distress caused. The information commissioner, states the penalty notice, "Remains mindful that DPP7 and the statutory conditions under section 55A are concerned with measures and the kind of contravention, rather than with any actual data breach." This is an important point that applies equally to the DPA 2018 and GDPR - companies do not have to suffer a breach to be in non-compliance with the law and subject to financial penalties.
