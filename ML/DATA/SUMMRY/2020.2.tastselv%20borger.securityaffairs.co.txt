A glitch in the TastSelv Borger tax service has sent over one million Danish CPR numbers to the US companies Google and Adobe. The good news is that according to the Agency, data was encrypted, it also added that Google and Adobe were not able to see the CPR numbers. Peter Kruse, cyber security expert and founder of the CSIS group, explained that Google had access to 1.2 million Danes' CPR numbers because they were in plain text. "Google has accessed 1.2 million Danes' CPR numbers." The Danish Agency for Development and Simplification attempted to downplay the incident and confirmed that CPR numbers have been encrypted. Once the users have corrected their contact information, an error in the application caused CPR numbers being sent to Google and Adobe as part of a web address. "Together with the Development and Simplification Agency, we have addressed potential vulnerabilities. Based on our immediate review, we currently have no reason to believe that data has been compromised. We are continuing to investigate the matter in close cooperation with the Development and Simplification Board." said DXC. In 2014, the company CSC was involved in a similar incident that exposed 900,000 CPR numbers.
