A cybersecurity breach at the Department of Veterans Affairs has potentially exposed personnel information for 46,000 veterans, the agency said Monday in a statement. VA is alerting impacted veterans, including their family members or next-of-kin, about the data breach, the department said. Veterans will receive more information by mail, which will include instructions on the steps they can take to protect their personal data. Veterans who don't receive any alert from the department were not impacted by the recent data breach, VA said. The VA data breach is relatively small compared to those that other federal agencies have experienced in recent years. The Defense Information Systems Agency reported a data breach earlier this year, which impacted 200,000 people. A 2018 data breach at the U.S. Postal Service affected nearly 60 million record holders.
