The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has confirmed that an ongoing ransomware attack is likely to be by serious international organised cyber-crime groups intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds. In a statement issued Thursday evening, the agency said it was continuing to respond to an ongoing ransomware attack that began at a minute past midnight on Christmas Eve. The incident is subject to a live criminal investigation, SEPA said, as the agency's emergency management team works with the Scottish Government, Police Scotland and the National Cyber Security Centre to respond to "What is complex and sophisticated criminality". "Whilst having moved quickly to isolate our systems, cyber security specialists, working with SEPA, Scottish Government, Police Scotland and the National Cyber Security Centre have now confirmed the significance of the ongoing incident," SEPA chief executive Terry A'Hearn said. "Partners have confirmed that SEPA remains subject to an ongoing ransomware attack likely to be by international serious and organised cyber-crime groups intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds." Procurement and project information, as well as personal information relating to SEPA staff, has also been breached. Priority regulatory, monitoring, flood forecasting and warning services are adapting and continuing to operate, SEPA said.
