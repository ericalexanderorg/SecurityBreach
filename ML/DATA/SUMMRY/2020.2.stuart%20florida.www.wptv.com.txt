At least six suspected drug dealers walked away free after Stuart prosecutors were forced to drop cases for lack of evidence. The problem? The evidence is currently sitting in computers at the Stuart Police Dept., but hackers have locked investigators out of the files which could have put the suspected drug dealers behind bars for years. Hackers hit Stuart with ransomware in April 2019, but the police department took the brunt of the damage. Contact 5 learned over the course of the investigation that losing data, or evidence in the case of the Stuart Police Dept., is highly common when an agency is hit by hackers. Investigators revealed the police department is still recovering from the hack, which started when a virus called 'Ryuk' infiltrated the system. The hackers demanded $300,000 in bitcoin, but the city of Stuart refused to pay the ransom. For at least six weeks, the small-town police department, which employs 46 sworn law enforcement officers, was forced to revert to pen and paper reports.
