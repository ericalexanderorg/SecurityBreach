Toyota Boshoku Corporation, a car components manufacturer member of the Toyota Group, announced today that one of its European subsidiaries lost more than $37 million following a business email compromise attack. This incident follows a previous security breach disclosed by Toyota in March that impacted roughly 3.1 million customers whose personal information may have been leaked following a security breach of multiple Toyota and Lexus sales subsidiaries. BEC fraud schemes are scam operations operated by fraudsters who attempt to deceive one or more employees of targeted organizations into wiring them money to bank accounts swapped with attacker-controlled ones. Some BEC victims recover some of the stolen funds by freezing them if they're not moved out of traceable accounts by the scammers, as it was the case with the Portland Public Schools which recovered roughly $2.9 million lost in a BEC attack during August. Others are not that fortunate, only having rescued some of the money lost, with the City of Saskatoon getting scammed out of $1.04 million and being in the process of recovering most of it, while Cabarrus County from North Carolina lost $1,728,082. Overall, BEC victims lost over $1,2 billion during 2018 according to an Internet Crime report issued in April 2019 by FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also published a report in July saying that BEC SAR filings increased from a $110 million monthly average in 2016 to over $301 million per month in 2018.
