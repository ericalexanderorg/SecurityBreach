The.csv file in this repository represents the work by IQT Labs to identify and create a living dataset of publicly reported software supply chain compromises. Dan Geer, Bentz Tozer, and John Speed Meyers used this dataset for a forthcoming article analyzing software supply chain compromises. Please help us maintain it by submitting pull requests to identify mistakes we made either of commission or by omission. Importantly, this dataset will quickly go out of date unless new attacks are added. Marc Ohm, Backstabber's Knife Collection, an open source malware research repository, link.
