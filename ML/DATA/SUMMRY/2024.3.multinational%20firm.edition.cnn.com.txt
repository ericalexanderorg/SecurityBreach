In early February 2024, a multinational firm in Hong Kong fell victim to a $25 million fraud orchestrated using deepfake technology. The scammers impersonated the companyâ€™s chief financial officer (CFO) and other staff members during a video conference call, successfully convincing a finance worker to transfer the substantial sum. This incident highlights the growing sophistication of digital fraud and the vulnerabilities in current digital identity verification processes. The fraudsters also misused stolen Hong Kong identity cards in conjunction with AI-generated deepfakes to deceive facial recognition systems.
