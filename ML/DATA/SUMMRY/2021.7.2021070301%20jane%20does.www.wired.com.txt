Russia's devastating SolarWinds spy campaign put the spotlight on the sophisticated supply chain hijacking techniques of Moscow's foreign intelligence hackers. It's now apparent that, throughout that SolarWinds spying and its fallout, another group of Kremlin hackers has kept up up their usual daily grind, using basic but often effective techniques to pry open practically any vulnerable network they could find across the US and the global internet. On Thursday the NSA, the FBI, the DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the UK's National Cybersecurity Centre issued a joint advisory warning of hundreds of attempted brute-force hacker intrusions around the world, all carried out by Unit 26165 of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, also widely known as Fancy Bear or APT28. The inclusion of energy sector targets in that hacking campaign raises an extra red flag, especially given that another GRU hacking team, Sandworm, remains the only hackers ever to trigger actual blackouts, sabotaging Ukrainian electric utilities in 2015 and 2016. The Department of Energy separately warned in early 2020 that hackers had targeted a US "Energy entity" just before Christmas in 2019. The GRU's brute-force hacking may be "Opportunistic" rather than targeted, argues Joe Slowik, who leads intelligence at security firm Gigamon and first spotted the connection between the Department of Energy alert and the GRU. He posits that the team may simply be gaining access to any network it can find before passing off that access to other Kremlin hackers with more specific missions, like espionage or disruption. The advisory notes that the hackers used Kubernetes, a server virtualization and automation tool.
