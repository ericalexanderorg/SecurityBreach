Hacktivist group NullBulge claims to have breached Disney, leaking 1.1 TiB of internal Slack data. A self-proclaimed hacktivist group named NullBulge, aiming to "Protect artists' rights and ensure fair compensation for their work," claims to have breached Disney and leaked 1.1 TiB of the company's internal Slack infrastructure. The breach, which is yet to be verified, allegedly contains a complete copy of the company's Slack communications used by their development team including messages, files, and other data exchanged within the Slack workspace. NullBulge also used X to announce the alleged hack, stating, "Disney has had their entire dev Slack dumped. 1.1 TiB of files and chat messages. Anything we could get our hands on, we downloaded and packaged up. Want to see what goes on behind the doors? Go grab it." "As for Disney, in recent years, the company has faced criticism and legal issues regarding the payment of fair shares to artists and writers. Prominent figures like Neil Gaiman have highlighted that Disney has stopped paying royalties to some writers and artists for works that include novelizations and graphic novels of Disney-owned properties. This issue affected various creators who worked on popular franchises such as"Star Wars" and "Alien. Organizations like the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America have been actively campaigning for these creators, forming task forces to pressure Disney into fulfilling its financial obligationsâ€‹.
