The fallout from the cyberattack on global meat producer JBS continued on Tuesday as the White House officially identified it as a ransomware attack and reports emerged of other downstream effects from the shutdown of the company's IT systems. While the initial JBS statement did not say it was a ransomware attack, Jean-Pierre confirmed that it was and told reporters on Tuesday the company had already gotten a ransom demand from an organization "Likely based in Russia." She did not say whether JBS plans to pay the ransom or not. She added that the White House is working with the Department of Agriculture, the FBI and CISA on helping JBS while also coordinating with meat suppliers across the country in case supply is affected by the attack. Bloomberg News and The Counter reported that the attack was already so damaging that the Department of Agriculture was unable to release the wholesale prices for beef and pork, affecting thousands involved in the agriculture market. Cybersecurity analysts drew parallels to the recent ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline that left much of the East Coast scrambling for gas for days. Many said this attack was worse because unlike gas, food will spoil and many ransomware attacks take weeks to recover from. The Associated Press noted that the Campari Group was hit with a ransomware attack last year while Molson Coors also announced that it was attacked in March.
