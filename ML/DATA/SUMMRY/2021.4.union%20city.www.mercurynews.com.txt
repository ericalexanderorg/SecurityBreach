Union City is hiring a cyber security manager about a year-and-a-half after a ransomware computer virus brought digital city systems to a screeching halt and forced a major back-end overhaul of file systems, security protocols and training. Vallejo said he and his team members have taken on the brunt of cyber security work while also heading up major city digitization efforts and day-to-day IT management, which he said does not provide effective security against looming digital threats. In September 2019, the city announced it fell victim to a virus that locked up portions of the city's systems, and as a precaution, much of the city staff was forced to temporarily give up email and other digital work norms, for "Old school" pen and paper, or other rudimentary workarounds. She said the city has instituted "a whole employee education and outreach program" including newsletters and updates on the latest security trends to help lower the risk of another attack succeeding against the city. Vallejo and Sugayan also said the cyber security manager will help the city stay in compliance with often changing requirements for data protection, such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, or PCI, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards, often referred to as HIPAA, and standards for Criminal Justice Information Systems, or CJIS. "It's really become an insurance requirement to have a position focused on cyber security," Vallejo added. While Vallejo said no personal information of residents or city contractors was released in the attack, many pieces of data were corrupted, and the city was forced to laboriously rebuild histories of datasets across departments. The new cyber security manager will be paid a minimum salary of $129,147, according to city reports, plus benefits.
