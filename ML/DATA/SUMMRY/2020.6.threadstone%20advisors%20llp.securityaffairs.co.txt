Maze ransomware operators hit Threadstone Advisors LLP, a US corporate advisory firm specialising in mergers 'n' acquisitions. Threadstone Advisors LLP, a corporate advisory firm specialising in mergers 'n' acquisitions, is the last victim of the Maze ransomware operators. MAZE ransomware operators have stolen the data of the company before encrypting its systems and threaten to leak it in case the victim will not pay the ransom. The Maze gang posted what appeared to be files stolen from Threadstone's systems on its leak site on the dark web. At the time it is not clear if Threadstone has paid any ransom demands. Maze ransomware operators are very active in this period, recently they have stolen data from US military contractor Westech and the ST Engineering group, and they have released credit card data stolen from the Bank of Costa Rica threatening to leak other lots every week. Previous victims of the ransomware gang include IT services firms Cognizant and Conduent.
