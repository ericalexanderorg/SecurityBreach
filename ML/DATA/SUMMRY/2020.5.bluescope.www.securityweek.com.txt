Australian steel producer BlueScope was recently hit by a cyberattack that caused disruptions to some of the company's operations. The company said on Friday that it responded to a "Cyber incident" detected at one of its US-based businesses. While BlueScope did not share any information about the type of attack, iTnews reported that the company was hit by ransomware and that it was working to restore systems from backups. BlueScope said the incident impacted some of its IT systems, mainly affecting manufacturing and sales operations in Australia. "Some processes have been paused, whilst other processes including steel despatches continue with some manual processes and workarounds," the company stated. "In the affected areas the Company has reverted to manual operations where possible while it fully assesses the impact and remediates as required, in order to return to normal operations as quickly as possible," BlueScope said. BlueScope is not the only major Australian company hit by ransomware in recent weeks.
