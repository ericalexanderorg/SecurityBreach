Microsoft declared that an Emotet attack took down an organization's network by overheating all the computers and bringing its Internet access down. Microsoft shared details of the Emotet attack suffered by an organization named Fabrikam in the Microsoft's Detection and Response Team Case Report 002, where Fabrikam is a fake name the IT giant gave the victim. "We are glad to share the DART Case Report 002: Full Operational Shutdown. In the report 002, we cover an actual incident response engagement where a polymorphic malware spread through the entire network of an organization." reads the Microsoft DART announcement. "After a phishing email delivered Emotet, a polymorphic virus that propagates via network shares and legacy protocols, the virus shut down the organization's core services. The virus avoided detection by antivirus solutions through regular updates from an attacker-controlled command-and-control infrastructure, and spread through the company's systems, causing network outages and shutting down essential services for nearly a week." The malware made lateral movements by stealing admin account credentials, and in just eight days after the initial infection, the Fabrikam's entire network was shut down. Microsoft experts successfully contained the Emotet infection and eradicated the malware from the infected network, then it deployed Microsoft Defender ATP and Azure ATP trials to detect and remove the malicious code. In 2019, security experts haven't detected any activity associated with Emotet since early April, when researchers at Trend Micro have uncovered a malware campaign distributing a new Emotet Trojan variant that compromises devices and uses them as Proxy C2 servers.
