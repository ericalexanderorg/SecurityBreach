The protected health information of 914,000 patients has potentially been compromised in two hacking incidents: A ransomware attack on the Florida Orthopedic Institute, one of the largest providers of orthopedic services in the state, and a malware attack on the billing and collection agency Benefit Recovery Specialists. Tampa Bay, FL-based Florida Orthopedic Institute has started notifying 640,000 patients that some of their protected health information may have been obtained by hackers in a recent ransomware attack. The subsequent investigation confirmed on May 6, 2020 that patient data was potentially accessed or stolen in the attack. The types of data potentially obtained by the hackers prior to the deployment of ransomware included patient names, dates of birth, social security numbers, medical information related to appointment times, diagnosis codes, payment amounts, insurance plan identification numbers, physician locations, payer identification numbers, claims addresses, and/or FOI claims histories. The Texas-based billing and collection agency, Benefit Recovery Specialists Inc., a business associate used by several healthcare organizations, has announced that a hacker stole employee credentials and gained access to systems containing the protected health information of 274,000 patients of its healthcare provider clients. A subset of patients also had their Social Security number exposed. The data breach ranks as one of the top 5 healthcare data breaches to be reported so far in 2020.
