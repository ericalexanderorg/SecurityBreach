It's fair to say that by "Free speech" the site's creators didn't mean that anyone could freely download every message, photo, and video posted to the site, including sensitive geolocation data. A very basic bug in Parler's architecture nonetheless seems to have made it all too easy to do just that. Late Sunday night, Parler went offline after Amazon Web Services cut off hosting for the social media outlet, a decision that followed the site's use as a tool to plan and coordinate an insurrectionist, pro-Trump mob's invasion of the US Capitol building last week. In the days and hours before that shutdown, a group of hackers scrambled to download and archive the site, uploading dozens of terabytes of Parler data to the Internet Archive. The truth was far simpler: Parler lacked the most basic security measures that would have prevented the automated scraping of the site's data. In this case, the posts on Parler were simply listed in chronological order: Increase a value in a Parler post url by one, and you'd get the next post that appeared on the site. Parler also doesn't require authentication to view public posts and doesn't use any sort of "Rate limiting" that would cut off anyone accessing too many posts too quickly.
