Dec. 10, 2019, 3:29 p.m. ET.After demonstrators in Iran set fire to hundreds of bank branches last month in antigovernment protests, the authorities dealt with another less visible banking threat that is only now coming to fuller light: a security breach that exposed the information of millions of Iranian customer accounts. The first message warned that "We will burn the reputation of their banks the same way we torched their banks," referring to protesters across Iran who pillaged and burned about 730 bank branches. The message on Telegram also stated that the perpetrators had demanded payment from the banks but their request had been ignored, and therefore they would be releasing the details on millions of bank cards. The banks sent clients text messages and Iran's cyberpolice alerted them in an email titled, "Your bank account is in danger of illegal usage," and asked customers to visit a bank branch and replace their cards, according to a copy of the email published in Iranian media. The last major hacking targeting Iranians banks occurred in 2012 when hackers gained access to the account information of three million users across 22 banks. In the United States, the Justice Department accused Iran of major cyberattacks from 2011 to 2013 targeting several American banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, US Bank and PNC Bank. Amir Rashidi, an Iranian internet expert who designed the cyberstructure of Iran's state-owned petrochemical industry, said that although Iran's state-sponsored hackers are sophisticated, the cybersecurity of most government entities and banks in the country "Is in shambles."
