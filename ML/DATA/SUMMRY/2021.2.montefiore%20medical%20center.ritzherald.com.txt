Montefiore is notifying some patients about a security breach involving information illegally accessed by a former employee. Categories of personal information accessed varied and may include first and last names, medical record numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and the last 4-digits of Social Security numbers. There is no evidence that financial information, including credit card numbers, were accessed, or that patient information was used for identity theft. Upon learning of this situation, Montefiore immediately deactivated the employee's access to the electronic medical record system. "We apologize for any inconvenience to our patients that this breach has caused," said Robert Dalrymple, Chief Information Security Officer, Montefiore Medical Center. Montefiore is providing identity theft protection services through IDX at no cost to patients affected by this breach. Protection includes 12 months of credit monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, educational materials, and access to fraud resolution representatives.
