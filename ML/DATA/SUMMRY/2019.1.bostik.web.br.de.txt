For a number of years now, a group of professional hackers has been busy spying on businesses all over the world: Winnti. The Winnti hackers broke into Henkel's network in 2014. The hackers behind Winnti have also set their sights on Japan's biggest chemical company, Shin-Etsu Chemical. At Gameforge, the Winnti hackers had already been removed from the networks when a staff member noticed a Windows start screen with Chinese characters. The job of DCSO's IT security experts is to observe and recognize hacker groups like Winnti and to get to the bottom of their motives. The Winnti hackers managed to penetrate the networks of Lion Air and several telecommunications companies, and they at least did take Marriott into their sights. The German government's response is elusive, when asked whether there is a connection between the Winnti hackers and the Chinese Government.
