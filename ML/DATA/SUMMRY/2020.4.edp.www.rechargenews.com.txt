European utility giant EDP has been hit by a cyberattack and is facing a â‚¬10m ransomware demand, according to multiple reports in the Portuguese media. Portugal-based EDP - majority-owner of EDPR, one of the world's largest wind power operators - was the subject of the cybersecurity breach on Monday, according to local reports and coverage in specialist IT publications. EDP has not so far responded to requests by Recharge for comment. EDPR said in a statement sent to Recharge that its operations and energy supply are operating normally. Recharge reported late last year how utilities were seen as increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with a study of industry professionals by Siemens finding growing rates of incidents. EDP, Portugal's largest utility, owns most of EDPR, which operates more than 11GW of renewables capacity globally and is one of the biggest players in US onshore wind. EDPR is also a growing force in offshore wind, and recently formed a joint venture with France's Engie in a bid to become one of the world's leaders in wind at sea.
