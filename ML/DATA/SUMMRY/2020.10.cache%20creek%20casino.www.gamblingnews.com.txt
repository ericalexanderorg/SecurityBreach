On September 20, Northern California's Cache Creek Casino Resort announced it would shut down temporarily. As the investigation continues, Cache Creek Casino already has an action plan. Cache Creek Casino has refused to comment on the authenticity of this statement. Specifically, Cache Creek Casino will fortify its infrastructure before reopening for business, the spokesperson said for the Bee.
