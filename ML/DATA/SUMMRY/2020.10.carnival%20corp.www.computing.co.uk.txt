Cruise firm Carnival has revealed that hackers were able to access guests' and employees' personal information from three different cruise lines, in a ransomware attack on the 15th August. Carnival owns all three of the hacked companies: Holland America Line, Carnival Cruise Line and Seabourn. Carnival is working with external cyber security experts to recover its data. The firm expects to complete the process in the next 30 to 60 days, after which all potentially affected individuals will be notified. The company says it will offer complimentary credit monitoring to affected individuals, as appropriate. On the 17th August, Carnival announced that it had identified a ransomware attack targetting some of its computer systems two days earlier. "Based on its preliminary assessment and on the information currently known, the Company does not believe the incident will have a material impact on its business, operations or financial results," Carnival said in August.
