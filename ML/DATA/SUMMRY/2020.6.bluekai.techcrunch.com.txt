TechCrunch reviewed the data shared by Sen and found names, home addresses, email addresses and other identifiable data in the database. Marketers can either tap into Oracle's enormous bank of data, which it pulls in from credit agencies, analytics firms, and other sources of consumer data including billions of daily location data points, in order to target their ads. Jonathan Mayer, a science professor at Princeton University, told TechCrunch that BlueKai is one of the leading systems for linking data. Behind the scenes, BlueKai continuously ingests and matches as much raw personal data as it can against each person's profile, constantly enriching that profile data to make sure it's up to date and relevant. Under California state law, companies like Oracle are required to publicly disclose data security incidents, but Oracle has not to date declared the lapse. One estimate says BlueKai tracks over 1% of all web traffic - an unfathomable amount of daily data collection - and tracks some of the world's biggest websites: Amazon, ESPN, Forbes, Glassdoor, Healthline, Levi's, MSN.com, Rotten Tomatoes, and The New York Times. As invasive as it is that invisible trackers are feeding your web browsing data to a gigantic database in the cloud, it's that very same data that has kept the internet largely free for so long.
