Microsoft on Friday warned of active attacks exploiting unpatched Exchange Servers carried out by multiple threat actors, as the hacking campaign is believed to have infected tens of thousands of businesses, government entities in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. A successful exploitation of the flaws allows the adversaries to break into Microsoft Exchange Servers in target environments and subsequently allow the installation of unauthorized web-based backdoors to facilitate long-term access. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which released an emergency directive warning of "Active exploitation" of the vulnerabilities, urged government agencies running vulnerable versions of Exchange Server to either update the software or disconnect the products from their networks. "CISA is aware of widespread domestic and international exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and urges scanning Exchange Server logs with Microsoft's IoC detection tool to help determine compromise," the agency tweeted on March 6. FireEye's Mandiant threat intelligence team said it "Observed multiple instances of abuse of Microsoft Exchange Server within at least one client environment" since the start of the year. Aside from rolling out fixes, Microsoft has published new alternative mitigation guidance to help Exchange customers who need more time to patch their deployments, in addition to pushing out a new update for the Microsoft Safety Scanner tool to detect web shells and releasing a script for checking HAFNIUM indicators of compromise. "The broad installation of Exchange and its exposure to the internet mean that many organizations running an on-premises Exchange server could be at risk," Gangwer added.
