North Korea-linked Lazarus APT has been stealing payment card data from customers of large retailers in the U.S. and Europe for at least a year. Sansec researchers reported that North Korea-linked Lazarus APT group has been stealing payment card information from customers of large retailers in the U.S. and Europe for at least a year. The threat actors compromised legitimate websites to exfiltrate the stolen credit card data using an e-skimmer. Researchers were investigating e-skimming attacks when noticed that the malicious code was loaded from domains that were involved in spear-phishing campaign attributed to the Lazarus APT. The e-skimmer code used in the attacks shared the same codebase, the list of victims includes dozens of stores such as the accessories giant Claire's, Focus Camera, CBD Armour, Microbattery, and Realchems. North Korean hackers also used to register domain names similar to those of victim shops to avoid being detected while exfiltrating payment card data. In some attacks, the malware disappeared in 24 hours from the compromised site and re-appeared on the same store after a few days, in the meantime stolen data were redirected to another domain. "Sansec has found proof of global skimming activity that has multiple, independent links to previously documented, North Korea attributed hacking operations. Sansec believes that North Korean state sponsored actors have engaged in large scale digital skimming activity since at least May 2019." concludes the researchers.
