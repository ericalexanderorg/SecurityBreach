A court order obtained by Experian allowed to seize the fraudsters' equipment and stolen data was secured and deleted. "We can confirm that no consumer credit or consumer financial information was obtained. Our investigations do not indicate that any misappropriated data has been used for fraudulent purposes. Our investigations also show that the suspect had intended to use the data to create marketing leads to offer insurance and credit-related services." "I would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to any affected parties. Our first priority is to help and support consumers and businesses in South Africa." said Experian Africa CEO Ferdie Pieterse.
