In January 2021, we discovered a new supply-chain attack compromising the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, an Android emulator for PCs and Macs, and part of BigNox's product range with over 150 million users worldwide. Among them, only 5 users received a malicious update, showing that Operation NightScout is a highly targeted operation. It is important to highlight that, in contrast with similar previous operations such as the Winnti Group activity targeting the gaming industry in 2019, we haven't found indicators that would suggest indiscriminate proliferation of malicious updates among a large number NoxPlayer users, reinforcing our belief that this is a highly targeted operation. Will supply the update parameters received to another binary in its toolbox NoxPack. The BigNox API server responds to the client request with specific update information, including the URL to download the update from BigNox legitimate infrastructure. The legitimate update stored in BigNox infrastructure could have been replaced with malware, or it may be a new filename/URL not used by legitimate updates. Contrary to legitimate BigNox updates, the malicious files are not digitally signed, strongly suggesting that the BigNox build system was not compromised, but just its systems that distribute updates.
