A hacker has been able to send messages via text, email, and landline to tens of thousands of people across Australia after an emergency warning alert service, used by councils, was hacked. The message sent from the Early Warning Network on Friday night warned "EWN has been hacked. Your personal data is not safe. Trying to fix the security issues". EWN said a hacker accessed its alerting system and sent the message to part of its database. "EWN staff at the time were able to quickly identify the attack and shut off our systems limiting the amount of messages sent out. Unfortunately, a small proportion of our database received this alert." "The actual data held in our system is just 'white pages' type data, we deliberately don't hold any other personal information." The company said it's warning system remained fully operational during the breach and that it was working with the Queensland Police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre on the investigation. Mr Plowright said in the case of the NT, the EWN would usually be responsible for providing data to a number of "Blue chip" clients, including councils, regarding when and how a cyclone could hit.
