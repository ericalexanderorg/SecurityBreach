SevenRooms - a CRM system used by several major international restaurant chains and a collection of other hospitality businesses - has suffered a data breach. This is especially pertinent with regard to CRM systems due to the large volumes of customer data businesses use them to store. Data posted in the samples includes files pertaining to big restaurant chains, SevenRooms clients, promo codes, payment reports, reservation lists, and API keys. The Importance of Using a Secure CRM. Although it's good to know that sensitive information wasn't stored on the affected servers, the breach is still likely to spook SevenRooms customers and clients, which includes big names such as Wolfgang Puck, MGM Resorts, and Bloomin' Brands. All software your business uses should have watertight security systems - but the stakes are even higher if you're constantly managing, storing, and utilizing data and information customers are trusting you to keep secure, which is what CRM systems are for. Nowadays, a secure CRM system will provide you with various tools to keep your customer and client data secure, including IP restriction powers, multi-factor authentication, Single-Sign on, and data restrictions you can set based on employees' roles. Combining a CRM with these features with additional cybersecurity tools like password managers will ensure that none of your employees' devices or CRM accounts will be easy targets.
