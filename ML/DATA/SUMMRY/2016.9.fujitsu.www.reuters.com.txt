The Cloud Hopper attacks carry worrying lessons for government officials and technology companies struggling to manage security threats. Chinese hackers, including a group known as APT10, were able to continue the attacks in the face of a counter-offensive by top security specialists and despite a 2015 U.S.-China pact to refrain from economic espionage. A spokesman for DXC, the services arm spun off by HPE in 2017, said the company put "Robust security measures in place" to protect itself and customers. The company called in outside experts, who found infections dating to at least January 2010.Hewlett Packard security staff fought back, tracking the intruders, shoring up defenses and executing a carefully planned expulsion to simultaneously knock out all of the hackers' known footholds. A spokesman for Vale declined to comment on specific questions about the attacks but said the company adopts "The best practices in the industry" to improve network security. The companies were battling a skilled adversary, said Rob Joyce, a senior adviser to the U.S. National Security Agency. "The security of HPE customer data is always our top priority," an HPE spokesman said.
