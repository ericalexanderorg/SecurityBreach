Fairfax County Public Schools, the 10th largest school division in the US, was recently hit by ransomware according to an official statement published on Friday evening. At the moment the exact date when the ransomware impacted FCPS's network is not yet known but the school district says that it collaborating with the FBI to determine what ransomware gang is behind the attack. "We currently believe we may have been victimized by cyber criminals who have been connected to dozens of ransomware attacks in other school systems and corporations worldwide." FCPS did not reveal the identity of the ransomware operators who encrypted their systems but it said says that they are known for dozens of attacks on other school districts and enterprises. The attack on FCPS was already claimed by the Maze ransomware operators who have already leaked 2% of what they claim to be data stolen from the Virginia school division's servers. The data leaked by Maze contains information on some of the school district's students, as well as administrative documents and what looks like an LSASS dump that can be used to extract Windows credentials. Maze ransomware is the one behind the new ransomware tactic of stealing victims' files before encrypting systems and using them as leverage to pressure the victims into paying the ransoms.
