Miklos Daniel Brody, a cloud engineer, was sentenced to two years in prison and a restitution of $529,000 for wiping the code repositories of his former employer in retaliation for being fired by the company. First Republic Bank was a commercial bank in the U.S., employing over seven thousand people and having an annual revenue of $6.75 billion. According to the U.S. Department of Justice announcement, Brody was fired on March 11, 2020, from First Republic Bank in San Francisco, where he worked as a cloud engineer. Following his dismissal, Brody allegedly refused to return his work laptop and instead used his still-valid account to access the bank's computer network and cause damages estimated to be above $220,000. "Among other things, Brody deleted the bank's code repositories, ran a malicious script to delete logs, left taunts within the bank's code for former colleagues, and impersonated other bank employees by opening sessions in their names," describes the U.S. DOJ announcement. In addition to the two-year prison term and the payment of the restitution, Brody will serve three years of supervised release. SIM swapper gets 8 years in prison for account hacks, crypto theft.
