In September 2017, credit reporting giant Equifax came clean: It had been hacked, and the sensitive personal information of 143 million US citizens had been compromised-a number the company later revised up to 147.9 million. In a sweeping nine-count indictment, the DOJ alleged that four members of China's People's Liberation Army were behind the Equifax hack, the culmination of a years-long investigation. That aggression dates back to a hack of the Office of Personnel Management, revealed in 2015, in which Chinese hackers allegedly stole reams of highly sensitive data relating to government workers, up through the more recently disclosed breaches of the Marriott hotel chain and Anthem health insurance. Within a week, the DOJ says, Chinese hackers were inside Equifax's systems. On May 13 the indictment says that one of the hackers ran a Structured Query Language command to identify general details about an Equifax data table, then sampled a select number of records from the database. The indictment alleges that the hackers first ran a series of SQL commands to find especially valuable data. China's hackers allegedly used a few techniques to maintain access to the motherlode.
