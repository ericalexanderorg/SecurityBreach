Since the Russian military agency known as the GRU first entered the spotlight as the hackers that targeted the 2016 US election, it's become increasingly known as the actor behind much of the Kremlin's most brazen digital behavior. Those include the breach of two US state boards of elections in 2016, the cyberattack on the 2018 Winter Olympics, and the hacking of the French election in 2017. In the process of that reporting, security researchers from companies including FireEye and ESET have shared crucial forensic connections that tie the group's hacking incidents into a single, connected, and evolving series of operations. Russia's GRU has long been suspected of responsibility for the breach that leaked 9 gigabytes of emails from the campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron just before the French election in early May of 2017-nearly a year after carrying out a similar campaign against the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton Campaign in the US. Now one fresh data point from security firm FireEye ties that operation directly to Sandworm, and specifically the NotPetya malware that would hit Ukraine and spread globally just a month after the French election. Robert Lipovsky, ESET. That link began with a hacking tool first spotted by cybersecurity firm ESET in 2016, a backdoor program written in the Visual Basic Scripting programming language that Sandworm had used in data-destroying attacks against Ukraine. ESET would later point to that VBS backdoor as a key point of evidence that Sandworm-which ESET calls Telebots-was responsible for NotPetya. In May of 2018, FireEye took a closer look at that VBS backdoor, specifically a command-and-control server based in Bulgaria that Sandworm had apparently used to communicate with it.
