Hackers caused havoc at four restaurant chains in the U.S. over the summer after compromising their payment systems with malware that stole customers' payment card information. In the last two days, McAlister's Deli, Moe's Southwest Grill, Schlotzsky's, and Hy-Vee disclosed publicly that their networks were infected with point-of-sale malware copying data from cards used in person at certain locations. Yesterday, the three Focus Brands subsidiaries provided details about a payment card security incident affecting corporate and franchised restaurants. As payment card data passed through a restaurant's server, the PoS malware copied from the card's magnetic stripe the card number, expiration date, and internal verification code; the cardholder's name was also available in some cases. Today's notification from Hy-Vee is an update for communication released on August 14 that informed customers of a payment data card incident discovered at an earlier date. In six locations there are suspicions that the start date for sweeping the card data was November 9, 2018. While PoS malware activity is far from its glory days, it continues to be good business as cards can sell for up to $35, depending on the brand, country, and amount of details they come with.
