DeRoyal Industries, the Powell-based medical supplies manufacturer with an international presence, suffered a cyberattack last week, a representative confirmed to Knox News on Tuesday. Chief administrative officer Rebecca Harmon said DeRoyal is working with the FBI after the company experienced what she described as a ransomware attack. Harmon said she could not provide details about how and to what extent DeRoyal was affected. Knoxville city leaders learned that firsthand when city servers were struck by a ransomware attack in June. DeRoyal was founded in 1978 by Knoxville businessman Pete DeBusk, a Lincoln Memorial University alumnus who started the Harrogate university's DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine. DeRoyal manufactures products for acute care, patient care and wound care. In addition to its headquarters in Powell, DeRoyal has East Tennessee facilities in Maynardville and New Tazewell, as well as plants in states including Florida, South Carolina and Virginia.
