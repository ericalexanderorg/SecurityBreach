A thorough investigation into reputed Chinese APT actor Winnti Group turned up a previously undocumented backdoor that was used to compromise a popular Asian mobile hardware and software vendor - perhaps as a prelude to launching a major supply chain attack against its users. ESET does not specifically name the Asian tech company that was targeted by the malware, but does note that it did notify the company and has been collaborating on a remediation of the attack. ESET researchers describe PortReuse as a "Listening-mode modular backdoor" that "Injects into a running process already listening on a TCP port." In essence, it is reusing an already open port; hence, its name. ESET further reports that PortReuse's initial launch file arrives in one of three formats: embedded in a.NET application the launches the Winnti packer shellcode, a VBScript that deserializes and invokes a.NET object that launches the shellcode, or as an executable with shellcode directly at the entry point. No command-and-control server address is coded into the malware, because it uses NetAgent, a module that handles TCP hooking, to listen in on open sockets for the attacker to connect directly to the compromised host. In some PortReuse variants of, NetAgent and SK3 are packaged together. Knowing the magic packet that triggers the malicious activity, ESET researchers, with assistance from public search engine Censys, scanned the internet for potential victims of the PortReuse campaign and found eight IP addresses that replied with an HTTP response that matched PortReuse's signature.
