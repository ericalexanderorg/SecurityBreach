Hackers from the China-linked Winnti group have compromised computer systems at two Hong Kong universities during the Hong Kong protests that started in March 2019. "In November 2019, we discovered a new campaign run by the Winnti Group against two Hong Kong universities. We found a new variant of the ShadowPad backdoor, the group's flagship backdoor, deployed using a new launcher and embedding numerous modules." reads the analysis published by ESET. "The Winnti malware was also found at these universities a few weeks prior to ShadowPad.". The Winnti group was first spotted by Kaspersky in 2013, but according to the researchers the gang has been active since 2007. The experts believe that under the Winnti umbrella there are several APT groups, including Winnti, Gref, PlayfullDragon, APT17, DeputyDog, Axiom, BARIUM, LEAD, PassCV, Wicked Panda, and ShadowPad. Experts discovered samples from both ShadowPad and Winnti at the universities that were containing campaign identifiers and C&C URLs with the names of the universities, a circumstance that indicates a highly targeted attack. "One can observe that the C&C URL used by both Winnti and ShadowPad complies to the scheme.domain.tld:443 where is a single letter which is either"w" in the case of the Winnti malware or "b" in the case of ShadowPad." continues the report. Tld:443 where is a single letter which is either "w" in the case of the Winnti malware or "b" in the case of ShadowPad. Analyzing the C&C URL format experts determined that hackers targeted three additional Hong Kong universities.
