For the last decade, the hackers behind Evil Corp have led a sustained assault on the bank accounts of thousands of victims across dozens of countries. Thursday, the FBI indicted Evil Corp's alleged leader: Maksim V. Yakubets, also known as "Aqua." Since at least 2011, the FBI estimates that Bugat-also known as Dridex and Cridex-resulted in losses of $100 million or more across hundreds of banks. What makes the Evil Corp campaign so impressive isn't just the scale, but how adaptable it has proved to be. Over the years, Brady said, Evil Corp has switched from a centralized command-and-control center to peer-to-peer botnets to make their activities harder to trace, used more sophisticated so-called web injects to trick users into entering sensitive information, and ditched international wire transfers for the relative anonymity of ransomware tied to cryptocurrency payments. In all, Yakubets and Turashev have been indicted on 10 Bugat-related counts, covering conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud, and bank fraud. Zeus attacks netted $70 million from US targets, a diverse list that includes banks, a luggage store, and the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago.
