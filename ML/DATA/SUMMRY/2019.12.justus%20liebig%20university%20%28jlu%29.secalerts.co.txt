A German university is going 'old school' and issuing new passwords for the email accounts of all 38,000 of its students and staff ... by hand, leading to the unusual sight of people queuing 'around the block' on the university campus. The Justus Liebig University in the northern Germany town of Gie√üen was forced to take the measures after what the university has referred to as a 'suspected cyber attack' by unknown malware. The university's network was taken down on December 8 and all computers were isolated from each other and disconnected from the internet. "This should make the second wave of scans at the JLU considerably easier," said the university. As an added precaution, the university computing center decided to issue new passwords for all 38,000 JLU email accounts. The university was unable to do this online because of a quirk of German law, whereby the German National Research and Education Network requires, in this case, JLU students and staff to obtain their new passwords in person from the university's IT staff, using as ID card to prove their identity. The university says the current emergency is expected to last several weeks but hopes to "Restore email communication skills for all members and members of the JLU before the Christmas break."
