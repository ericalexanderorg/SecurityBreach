Lorien Health Services in Maryland announced that it was the victim of a ransomware incident in early June. Responsible for the attack are Netwalker ransomware operators, who leaked the information after Lorien refused to pay the ransom demand. A family-owned nursing home for the elders, Lorien Health Services runs nine locations in Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, and Howard counties, as well as a rehabilitation and fitness facility. The company says that the incident was detected on June 6 and contracted services of cybersecurity experts to start an investigation and determine the impact. Their targets include corporate networks vulnerable to remote desktop hacks but as the Lorien incident shows, they are not picky about who they attack as long as they get paid. Lorien sent notification letters to "All potentially impacted residents" on June 16, two days after the hackers announced a successful attack. The letters included details about the attack and the options for protecting personal information, along with complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services.
