Magecart attackers have compromised web shops belonging to large retail chains Claire's and Intersport and equipped them with payment card skimmers. The skimmer was served from a domain made to look like it might belong to the company, and it was added to the two online stores between April 25th and 30th. "The malware was added to the app.min.js file. This file is hosted on the store servers, so there is no"Supply Chain Attack" involved, and attackers have actually gained write access to the store code," the researchers pointed out. How the attackers managed to compromise the web shops is still unknown, but they started planning the attack a month before actually executing it. ESET researchers have pointed out the compromise of Intersport's web store and said that the company fixed the issue within several hours of ESET letting them know. Sansec researchers say that an initial hack happened on Apr 30th and then another one on May 14th:. Intersport stores got hacked on Apr 30th, cleaned on May 3rd, then hacked again on May 14th. pic. Only the localized Intersport web shops serving customers from the Balkans region have been compromised. None of the compromised web shops sport a prominent notification about the breach and payment card info theft.
