An inspector general report has found there were "Unacceptable" delays in reporting an April security breach of Kentucky's unemployment system but that residents' personal information doesn't appear to have been misused. The report primarily blames the monthlong delay in reporting the breach on current legal staff who relied on a holdover procedure from the previous administration that misinterpreted state law governing when breaches need to be reported. There were "Unacceptable" delays in assessing and properly reporting the breach, the report found, adding that it appears several of the delays "Were exacerbated by what appears to be a fundamental misreading of the initial reporting requirements". The report found the state took "Reasonable and timely" action to fix the breach and that the delay in reporting didn't prevent the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet from securing sensitive information of jobless claim filers. Kentucky statute requires state agencies to report a security breach related to personal information to other agencies, including the Kentucky State Police and attorney general. The inspector general report also notes how the attorney general's office first asked the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet on May 19 about the delay in reporting the data breach. Attorneys in the governor's office determined the breach should have been reported, and the reporting forms were sent out.
