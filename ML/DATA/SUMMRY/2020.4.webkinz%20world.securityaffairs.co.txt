ZDNet reported that a hacker has leaked 23 million credentials from the Webkinz World online children's game. Webkinz are stuffed animals that have a playable online counterpart, www. Webkinz.com, in "Webkinz World." Webkinz were originally released by the Canadian toy company Ganz on April 29, 2005. Each Webkinz toy has an attached tag with a unique "Secret Code" printed on it that allows you to play with your pet in the "Webkinz World" website. On Webkinz World, the Secret Code allows the user to own a virtual version of the pet for online play. "ZDNet has learned that details about the vulnerability have been circulating online before today's leak for months, both on hacking forums and on online IM chat groups." reported ZDNet. At the time of writing, the Webkinz staff had discovered the breach and addressed the flaw exploited by hackers.
