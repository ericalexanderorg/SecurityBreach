The Town Hall is working to support residents after a serious cyber attack first revealed on 13 October continues to leave many of its systems paralysed. Following the attack, the council has found itself unable to properly operate a number of key services, accept rents, service charges, council tax and business rates, and make housing benefit payments. While some reports raised fears of evictions as a result of the impact on housing benefit payment, it is understood that the council is in dialogue with landlords in the borough to whom housing benefit is paid directly, and is directly contacting those impacted by disrupted payments to offer them help and support. The Town Hall has not confirmed whether the incident is similar in nature to the ransomware attack that hit Redcar Council earlier this year, which is understood to have forced the local authority to rebuild its affected services from scratch at a cost of over Â£10m. Key essential services, including the Town Hall's emergency coronavirus response, continue to operate, with staff now working to restore processes and protect residents' data. It is understood that there is no evidence of residents receiving unsolicited emails, calls or texts asking for information following the attack, with the council and the ICO investigating if personal data has been accessed or compromised. If you have not received a payment you were expecting from the council and you need support and advice, you can contact the council here. There are some occasions when council staff phone residents to discuss payment.
