Hackers from the FIN7 cybercriminal group have been targeting various businesses with malicious USBâ€Œ devices acting as a keyboard when plugged into a computer. "Recently, the cybercriminal group FIN7,1 known for targeting such businesses through phishing emails, deployed an additional tactic of mailing USB devices via the United States Postal Service. The mailed packages sometimes include items like teddy bears or gift cards to employees of target companies working in the Human Resources, Information Technology, or Executive Management roles," the FBI alert states. The FBI says that the malicious drive is configured to emulate keystrokes that launch a PowerShell command to retrieve malware from server controlled by the attacker. The days when USB flash drives were just for storage are long gone. These are called HID or USB drive-by attacks are easy to pull and don't cost much. Trustwave analyzed this malicious USB activity and noticed two PowerShell commands that lead to showing a fake error for the thumb drive and ultimately to running third-stage JavaScript that can collect system information and downloading other malware. Organizations can take precautions against attacks via malicious USB drives by allowing only vetted devices based on their hardware ID and denying all others.
