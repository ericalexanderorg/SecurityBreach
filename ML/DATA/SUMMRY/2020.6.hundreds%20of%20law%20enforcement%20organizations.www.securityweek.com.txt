Hundreds of thousands of files belonging to more than 200 law enforcement organizations across the United States have been leaked online after they were stolen by hackers from a web development company. The files were made available by Distributed Denial of Secrets, a WikiLeaks-style organization that describes itself as a "Transparency collective" whose goal is the "Free transmission of data in the public interest." The leak, dubbed BlueLeaks, includes information collected and generated by over 200 police departments, fusion centers, the FBI and other law enforcement organizations in various U.S. states. The NFCA, which determined that the exposed files are dated between 1996 and June 2020, is concerned that threat actors could leverage the leaked data to target the impacted law enforcement organizations and their employees. The leaked data includes both personal and financial information. Law enforcement organizations in the United States have been increasingly targeted by hacktivists over the past weeks following the death of George Floyd in police custody and the protests sparked by the incident. The personal information of many police officers was leaked online recently and while in some cases the details were obtained from public sources, some of it may have come from hacked online accounts.
