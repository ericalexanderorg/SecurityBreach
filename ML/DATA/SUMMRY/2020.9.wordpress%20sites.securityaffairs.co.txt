The vulnerability was first discovered by Gonzalo Cruz from Arsys, the researcher also confirmed that threat actors are already exploiting the flaw to upload malicious PHP files onto vulnerable sites. "From our firewall attack data, it appears that attackers may be probing for the vulnerability with empty files and if successful, may attempt to inject a malicious file. Experts strongly recommend updating to the latest version of the File Manager plugin, version 6.9 at the time of writing this post.
