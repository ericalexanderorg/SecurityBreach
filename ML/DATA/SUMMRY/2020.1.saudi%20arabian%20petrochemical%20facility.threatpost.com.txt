Researchers found malware called Triton on the industrial control systems of a company located in the Middle East. Researchers are comparing Triton's targeting of industrial control systems to malware used in watershed attacks Stuxnet and Industroyer. According to researchers at Dragos, credited for discovering the malware last month, Triton targets the Triconex Safety Instrumented System by "Enabling the replacement of logic in final control elements." "It is not currently known what exactly the safety implications of Trisis would be. Logic changes on the final control element implies that there could be risk to the safety as set points could be changed for when the safety system would or would not take control of the process in an unsafe condition," Dragos stated in a report detailing the malware. Triton attack scenarios include using the malware to shut down the Triconex SIS process that is in a safe state. Dragos said Triton as having a "Game-changing" impact on industrial control systems and specifically safety systems. Schneider offers a number of detection and mitigation measures in its advisory that range from making sure Triconex systems are deployed on isolated networks and that USB drives, CDs or laptops connecting to that network should be scanned for malware ahead of time.
