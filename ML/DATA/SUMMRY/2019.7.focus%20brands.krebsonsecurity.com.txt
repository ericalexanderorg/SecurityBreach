On Nov. 23, one of the cybercrime underground's largest bazaars for buying and selling stolen payment card data announced the immediate availability of some four million freshly-hacked debit and credit cards. KrebsOnSecurity has learned this latest batch of cards was siphoned from four different compromised restaurant chains that are most prevalent across the midwest and eastern United States. Two financial industry sources who track payment card fraud and asked to remain anonymous for this story said the four million cards were taken in breaches recently disclosed by restaurant chains Krystal, Moe's, McAlister's Deli and Schlotzsky's. The stolen cards went up for sale at the infamous Joker's Stash carding bazaar. The most recent big breach marketed on Joker's Stash was dubbed "Solar Energy," and included more than five million cards stolen from restaurants, fuel pumps and drive-through coffee shops operated by Hy-Vee, a supermarket chain based in Iowa. According to Gemini, Joker's Stash likely delayed the debut of the New World Order cards to keep from flooding the market with too much stolen card data all at once, which can have the effect of lowering prices for stolen cards across the board. This type of point-of-sale malware is capable of copying data stored on a credit or debit card's magnetic stripe when those cards are swiped at compromised payment terminals, and that data can then be used to create counterfeit copies of the cards.
