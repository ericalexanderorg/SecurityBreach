The Russian hacker group known as REvil has named televangelist Kenneth Copeland as its latest victim, threatening to release 1.2 terrabytes of sensitive data if he declines to pay their unspecified ransom demands. REvil on Wednesday issued a statement saying it had taken over the servers of Kenneth Copeland Ministries, the Texas-based international church of the prominent 83-year-old pastor. What is REvil? REvil, also known as Sodinokibi, is a group of hackers that recruits affiliates to distribute ransomware for them. As part of the deal, REvil and the affiliates split any ransoms obtained using the group's malware. Short for 'ransomware evil,' REvil refers to both the group and its software. The hacker group REvil previously targeted celebrity law firm Grubman, Shire, Meiselas & Sacks, which refused to pay the millions in ransom that REvil demanded. In a recent interview with a Russian-language tech blog, a purported representative of REvil said that the group's most successful method of attack was through Remote Desktop Protocol, which allows for remote administration of a desktop over the internet.
