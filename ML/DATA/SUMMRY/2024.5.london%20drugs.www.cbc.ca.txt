London Drugs is gradually reopening its stores across Western Canada, six days after it shuttered all locations due to a "Cybersecurity incident," the retail and pharmacy chain said. "We ask for patience as we work with each store to ensure it is operating fully to meet the needs of our customers, and therefore we will not be communicating which stores are opening and when," London Drugs said in a Saturday statement. On Sunday, it said 28 of the chain's 79 locations had reopened, including 22 of its 52 stores in B.C. Pharmacists are available at all stores for emergency prescription and urgent care needs, and Canada Post offices located within stores are also open, according to London Drugs. Customers in need of pharmacy help are asked to visit stores in person for assistance. The company closed all of its stores across Western Canada until further notice after the cyberattack was discovered on April 28. While some customers told CBC they are happy to see their local London Drugs stores up and running again on Sunday, one business expert noted there is hard work ahead for the company to repair its relationship with loyal shoppers. Harries says London Drugs needs to communicate clearly about when and where stores are open, and which services are available, through its loyalty program or in emails to customers.
