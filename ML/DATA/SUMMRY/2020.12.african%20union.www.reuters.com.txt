Acting on a tip from Japanese cyber researchers, the African Union's technology staffers discovered that a group of suspected Chinese hackers had rigged a cluster of servers in the basement of an administrative annex to quietly siphon surveillance videos from across the AU's sprawling campus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. The security breach was carried out by a Chinese hacking group nicknamed "Bronze President," according to a five-page internal memo reviewed by Reuters. "We cannot estimate the quantity and value of the data which have been stolen," the memo continued, adding that while AU technicians had managed to interrupt the flow of data, the hackers could easily regain the upper hand. Chinese workers built the AU's showpiece new conference center in 2012 and Chinese technicians still help maintain the organization's digital infrastructure. The Chinese mission to the AU said in an email that "The AU side has not mentioned being hacked on any occasion" and that Africa and China are "Good friends, partners and brothers." Both the AU and the Chinese government vehemently denied the report at the time, but a former AU official told Reuters the article in Le Monde was accurate and had put officials there on high alert over cyberespionage. The memo said the hackers were able to siphon off "a huge volume of traffic" from the servers by hiding it in the regular flow of data leaving the AU's network during business hours, even pausing their data theft during lunch.
