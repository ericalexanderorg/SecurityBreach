Nearly twice as many accounts were affected by the recent Nintendo security breach as previously thought. That brings the total number of potentially affected accounts to around 300,000 : nearly double the figure of 160,000 that the company originally touted back in April. The passwords for those 140,000 new accounts have been reset, and the customers behind them contacted. Nintendo states that the number of impacted accounts amounts to less than 1% of all NNIDs around the world. Nintendo has been investigating this issue since late April, after an increasing number of fans grew concerned over their accounts being accessed in the wake of the initial breach. Those affected will have had data including their email, date of birth, and country or region made viewable to third parties. Credit card data couldn't be accessed, but payments could be taken via PayPal.
