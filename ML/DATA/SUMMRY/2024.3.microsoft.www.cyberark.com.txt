Today's blog post sheds light on who exactly APT29 is, its motives, what tactics it continues to use - and ultimately, how organizations might prevent similar attacks from happening to them. Cozy Bear has since been linked to several high-profile cyber-attacks, including the 2016 breach of the Democratic National Committee, the SolarWinds supply chain attack of 2019 and the Republican National Committee in 2021. Based on the details provided by Microsoft at the time of this writing, it appears the initial objective of the attack was to acquire information. Based on the information provided by Microsoft on Jan. 19, it appears the threat actor gained access to a "Legacy, non-production test tenant account" through a password spray attack. Password spraying is a brute-force attack where the attacker slowly tries a list of passwords against accounts from various source IP addresses. The ATP29 attack on Microsoft is a textbook example of how ITDR is critical to an organization. This recent attack on Microsoft is a stark reminder of the persistent and sophisticated threats from nation-state threat actors.
