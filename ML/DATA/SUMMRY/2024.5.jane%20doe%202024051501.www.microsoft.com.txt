Since mid-April 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed the threat actor Storm-1811 misusing the client management tool Quick Assist to target users in social engineering attacks. Threat actors misuse Quick Assist features to perform social engineering attacks by pretending, for example, to be a trusted contact like Microsoft technical support or an IT professional from the target user's company to gain initial access to a target device. One of the social engineering techniques used by threat actors to obtain initial access to target devices using Quick Assist is through vishing attacks. During the call, the threat actor persuades the user to grant them access to their device through Quick Assist. Black Basta is a closed ransomware offering distributed by a small number of threat actors who typically rely on other threat actors for initial access, malicious infrastructure, and malware development. Since Black Basta first appeared in April 2022, Black Basta attackers have deployed the ransomware after receiving access from Qakbot and other malware distributors, highlighting the need for organizations to focus on attack stages prior to ransomware deployment to reduce the threat.
