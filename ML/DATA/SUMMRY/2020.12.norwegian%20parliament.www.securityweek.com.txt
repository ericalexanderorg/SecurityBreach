Norway's domestic spy agency on Tuesday blamed a Russian hacker group linked to Moscow's military intelligence for a cyberattack on the Norwegian parliament earlier this year. The Norwegian intelligence agency said the likely perpetrators were the Fancy Bear collective - a group regularly accused of attacks including on the US election - but there was not enough evidence to pursue charges. Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide later accused Russia of being behind the attack, and PST investigators have now strengthened her claims. Using a method known as a "Brute force attack", where multiple passwords and usernames are submitted with the hope of eventually getting the right combination, the hackers were able to download "Sensitive" information, PST said. Russia's embassy in Norway has yet to comment on the PST findings, but in October it lambasted Eriksen Soreide's accusation as "Unacceptable". While relations are generally good between NATO member Norway and Russia, who share a border in the Far North, several espionage cases on both sides have soured relations in recent years. Norway's intelligence agency regularly singles out Russia as one of the country's main espionage threats alongside Iran and China.
