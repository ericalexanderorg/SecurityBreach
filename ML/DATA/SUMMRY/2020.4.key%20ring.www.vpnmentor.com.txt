Led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, vpnMentor's research team recently discovered a data leak by the popular app Key Ring, that compromised the privacy and security of their 14 million users. Once the details of the leak were confirmed, we immediately contacted Key Ring and AWS to disclose the discovery and assist in fixing the leak. The implications of this data leak are not reserved just for Key Ring users. Key Ring is already no longer operating in the EU due to the inability to comply with GDPR. With California enacting its data privacy law in January 2020 - the CCPA - Key Ring could still have faced investigation and fines from the state's legislative bodies. Key Ring could have easily avoided this leak if it had taken some basic security measures to protect it's customer data. Key Ring users must be aware of a data breach that exposes so much of their sensitive data. This has included an enormous data leak exposing the data of 10,000s of American restaurant diners.
