Hackers have infiltrated an Italian health portal used to schedule COVID-19 vaccination appointments, news outlet CNN and others reported, based on sources from Italy's cybercrime police. On Sunday, August 2, 2021, threat actors locked up the IT system of the health department of Italy's Lazio region, home to capitol Rome, in a ransomware hijack that its health councillor Alessio D'Amato called the "The most serious cyber-attack ever carried out" on an Italian public sector administration. Zingaretti did not elaborate on how Italian security authorities suspected that culpability for the incident came from outside Italy. A cyber gang known as RansomEXX is said to have orchestrated the attack, sources reportedly told BleepingComputer. On August 3, 2020, Italy recorded nearly 4,800 new cases spiking its 7-day average to nearly 5,500 each day. To date, Italy has administered roughly 70 million full doses of COVID vaccines for about 58 percent of the country's population. Roughly 1,900 serious cyber attacks on Italy's public domain occurred in 2020, 10 percent of which were COVID-19 related, according to the Italian Association for Cybersecurity 2021 report.
