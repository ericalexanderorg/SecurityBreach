TLDR:. - Firebase allows for easy misconfiguration of security rules with zero warnings. This has resulted in hundreds of sites exposing a total of ~125 Million user records, including plaintext passwords & sensitive billing information. Ai had settled down, we set to work on scanning the entire internet for exposed PII via misconfigured Firebase instances. MrBruh wrote up a rudimentary scanner in Python that would check for Firebase configuration variables in websites or their loaded. Logykk rewrote the scanner in Go, unlike the prior it didn't seem to leak memory. Our initial estimate was that this was going to take ~11 days to scan through the 5 1/2 Million domains, but it turned out to be closer to 2-3 weeks which made this very much a waiting game. Once we had acquired our shortlist of potentially affected sites we ran it through a secondary scanner that Eva had made called Catalyst.
