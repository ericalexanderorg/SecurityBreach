New York fitness chain Town Sports has suffered a data breach after a database containing the personal information of over 600,000 people was exposed on the Internet. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic and closing of gyms to battle the disease's spread, Town Sports International was forced to file for bankruptcy on September 14, 2020. In a new report from Comparitech, a database belonging to Town Sports International was discovered and analyzed by security researcher Bob Diachenko. This database contained the user records for almost 600,000 members or staff, and contained personal information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, last four digits of credit cards, credit card expiration dates, and a member's billing history. Diachenko and security reporter Zack Whittaker contacted Town Sports on September 21, 2020, to disclose the exposed database but did not receive a response. "Scammers can use the database's personal information to make the message seem more convincing. Phishing messages usually contain links to phishing pages that look authentic and often identical to the official website, but in fact are copies designed to steal passwords or payment info," Comparitech stated in their report. Therefore all Town Sports customers should be careful of responding or visiting sites contained in emails referencing your gym membership.
