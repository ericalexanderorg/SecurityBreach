Facebook is facing yet another privacy faux pas in how its users' data is collected and used by third-party apps. The social media giant said that it recently discovered that 5,000 developers received data from Facebook users - long after their access to that data should have expired. In 2018, on the heels of the Cambridge Analytica privacy incident, Facebook debuted stricter controls over data collection by third-party app developers. To bolster its privacy policies, earlier in June, Facebook said it had started to report its privacy practices to a newly formed, independent Privacy Committee. Facebook said on Wednesday it would attempt to further tighten its policies around third-party data collection by providing developers with clearer guidance around data usage and sharing. "These new terms limit the information developers can share with third parties without explicit consent from people. They also strengthen data security requirements and clarify when developers must delete data." Threatpost has reached out to Facebook for further comment on the privacy flaw, as well as its new privacy policies for developers.
