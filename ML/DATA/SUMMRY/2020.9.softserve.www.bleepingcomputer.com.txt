Ukrainian software developer and IT services provider SoftServe suffered a ransomware attack on September 1st that may have led to the theft of customers' source code. "Today at 1AM in the morning SoftServe came under cyber attack. Attackers got access to company infrastructure and managed to launch encrypting ransomeware along with some other malware.We have taken some of our services offline to stop spread of attack, unfortunately your work will be suffering from our containment steps in coming hours ...We also blocked tunnels to our customers networks to avoid spread of malware to their infrastructure." In a subsequent statement to Ukrainian technology news site AIN, SoftServe confirmed that a cyberattack had occurred that caused them to disconnect their clients to prevent its spread. "Yes, there was an attack today. The most significant consequences of the attack are the temporary loss of functionality of a part of the mail system and the halt of some of the auxiliary test environments. As far as we can estimate, this is the greatest impact of the attack, and other systems or client data were not affected." An incident report found today by security researcher MalwareHunterTeam and shared with BleepingComputer, confirms that SoftServe suffered a ransomware attack. The report also includes a PowerShell script used to find files that were changed during the attack, indicating that the attack occurred between 2 AM and 9 AM. BleepingComputer has contacted SoftServe with further questions about the attack but has not heard back. According to the SoftService incident report, the attackers exploited a DLL hijacking vulnerabilitie in the legitimate Rainmeter application to deploy their ransomware. "Distributed ransomware DLL(Rainmeter.dll ) compiled from legitime Rainmeter - a desktop customization tool for Windows. Malicious DLL loading from legitime EXE using additional instruments like CobaltStrike Beacon, PowerShell, etc. Such technique is hard to detect by any antivirus as of now," the SoftServe incident report states.
