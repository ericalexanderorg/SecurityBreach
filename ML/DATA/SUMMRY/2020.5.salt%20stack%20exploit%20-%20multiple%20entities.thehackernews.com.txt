Days after cybersecurity researchers sounded the alarm over two critical vulnerabilities in the SaltStack configuration framework, a hacking campaign has already begun exploiting the flaws to breach servers of LineageOS, Ghost, and DigiCert. "Around 8 pm PST on May 2nd, 2020, an attacker used a CVE in our SaltStack master to gain access to our infrastructure," the company noted in its incident report but added Android builds and signing keys were unaffected by the breach. In its status page, the developers noted that "Around 1:30 am UTC on May 3rd, 2020, an attacker used a CVE in our SaltStack master to gain access to our infrastructure" and install a cryptocurrency miner. "The mining attempt spiked CPUs and quickly overloaded most of our systems, which alerted us to the issue immediately," Ghost added. Both LineageOS and Ghost have restored the services after taking the servers offline to patch the systems and secure them behind a new firewall. In a separate development, the Salt vulnerability was used to hack into DigiCert certificate authority as well. With F-Secure's alert revealing more than 6,000 Salt vulnerable servers that can be exploited via this vulnerability, if left unpatched, companies are advised to update the Salt software packages to the latest version to resolve the flaws.
