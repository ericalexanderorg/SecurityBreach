Agoura Hills, Calif.-based NVA bills itself as is the largest private owner of freestanding veterinary hospitals in the United States. A source close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that NVA was hit with Ryuk, a ransomware strain first spotted in August 2018 that targets mostly large organizations for a high-ransom return. She said, all of the NVA's hospitals have remained open and able to see clients, and access to patient records has been fully restored to all affected hospitals. "Around 2 am PT [Oct. 27], the Ryuk virus was unleashed at NVA. Approximately 400 locations were infected. [Microsoft] Active Directory and Exchange servers were infected. Many of the infected locations immediately lost access to their Patient Information Management systems. These locations were immediately unable to provide care." The source shared internal communications from different NVA executives to their hospitals about the extent of the remediation efforts and possible source of the compromise, which seemed to suggest that at least some NVA properties have been struggling to accommodate patients. In an update sent to NVA hospitals on Nov. 6, the company's new head of technology Greg Hartmann said its security system successfully blocked the ransomware from infiltrating its systems - at least at first. As for what changes NVA will be making to prevent yet another ransomware outbreak, an internal update on Nov. 7 from NVA's chief information officer Joe Leggio said NVA was investing in software from Carbon Black, a cloud-based security solution that will be installed on all NVA property computers.
