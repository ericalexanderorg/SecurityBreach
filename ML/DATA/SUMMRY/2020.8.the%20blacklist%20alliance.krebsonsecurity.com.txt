Enter The Blacklist Alliance, which promises to help marketers avoid TCPA legal snares set by "Professional plaintiffs and class action attorneys seeking to cash in on the TCPA." According to the Blacklist, one of the "Dirty tricks" used by TCPA "Frequent filers" includes "Phone flipping," or registering multiple prepaid cell phone numbers to receive calls intended for the person to whom a number was previously registered. The leaked Blacklist customer database points to various companies you might expect to see using automated calling systems to generate business, including real estate and life insurance providers, credit repair companies and a long list of online advertising firms and individual digital marketing specialists. The irony of this data leak is that marketers who constantly scrape the Web for consumer contact data may not realize the source of the information, and end up feeding it into automated systems that peddle dubious wares and services via automated phone calls and text messages. Robocalls are permitted for political candidates, but beyond that if the recording is a sales message and you haven't given your written permission to get calls from the company on the other end, the call is illegal. Readers may be able to avoid some marketing calls by registering their mobile number with the Do Not Call registry, but the list appears to do little to deter all automated calls - particularly scam calls that spoof their real number. AT&T offers wireless customers its free Call Protect app, which screens incoming calls and flags those that are likely spam calls. For my part, the volume of automated calls hitting my mobile number got so bad that I recently enabled a setting on my smart phone to simply send to voicemail all calls from numbers that aren't already in my contacts list.
