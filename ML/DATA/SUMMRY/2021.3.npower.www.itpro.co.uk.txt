Npower has scrapped its mobile app after learning that hackers obtained customer login details to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. The UK energy giant claims that hackers infiltrated customer accounts by credential stuffing, according to MoneySavingExpert.com, which involved using their login details from other websites to breach their Npower accounts. The energy firm didn't reveal when the hack took place or how many users were affected, although MoneySavingExpert said it saw an email from the company on 2 February warning customers their accounts had been locked. The firm has advised its customers whose accounts were accessed to change their passwords, although they're not being advised to contact their bank unless they notice any unusual activity on their statements. "Energy customers who have used the Npower app should immediately check their bank statements for unusual activity, as the breach included sort codes and the last four digits of customer bank accounts numbers leaving them wide open to fraud," Walsh continued. Despite being regularly notified that their details have been leaked to hackers, a large proportion of people are unlikely to change their passwords or deactivate their accounts. "We've contacted all affected customers to make them aware of the issue, encouraging them to change their passwords and advice on how to prevent unauthorised access to their online account," a company spokesperson told IT Pro.
