CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield on Wednesday said it had been hit with a data breach that compromised the personal information on approximately 1.1 million customers. As I noted in this Feb. 9, 2015 story, Anthem was breached not long after a malware campaign was erected that mimicked Anthem's domain names at the time of the breach. On Feb. 27, 2015, ThreatConnect published more information tying the same threat actors and modus operandi to a domain called "Prennera[dot]com". "It is believed that the prennera[dot]com domain may have been impersonating the Healthcare provider Premera Blue Cross, where the attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the 'm' with two 'n' characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would be seen five months later with the we11point[dot]com command and control infrastructure," ThreatConnect observed in a February 2015 blog post. Turns out, the same bulk registrant in China that registered the phony Premera and Anthem domains in April 2014 also registered two Carefirst look-alike domains - careflrst[dot]com and caref1rst[dot]com. ThreatConnect has unearthed evidence showing the same tactics were used on EmpireB1ue.com, a domain registered April 11, 2014. EmpireBlue BlueCross BlueShield was one of the organizations impacted by the Anthem breach.
