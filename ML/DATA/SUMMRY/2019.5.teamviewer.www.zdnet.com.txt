Chinese state-sponsored hackers breached German software maker TeamViewer in 2016, the company confirmed today to ZDNet after a report by German newspaper Der Spiegel. "In autumn 2016, TeamViewer was target of a cyber-attack," a TeamViewer spokesperson said via email. The company's statement is in opposition to what Der Spiegel reported, with the German newspaper claiming Chinese hackers have been present inside TeamViewer's network since 2014.Hackers deployed Winnti malware. According to Der Spiegel, the hackers who breached TeamViewer's netwok had used Winnti, a backdoor trojan historically known to be in the arsenal of Beijing state hackers. Hackers have always targeted TeamViewer because of the access the company's service can provide, in the case of a successful breach. Months before the successful Winnti hack in the fall of 2016, TeamViewer had faced a wave of user account hijacks, which many customers reported as originating from Chinese IP addresses. TeamViewer is not the only German company that has been hacked and infected with the Winnti malware over the past three years.
