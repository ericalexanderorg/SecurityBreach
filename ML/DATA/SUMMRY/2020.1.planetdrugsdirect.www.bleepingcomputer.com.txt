Canadian online pharmacy PlanetDrugsDirect is emailing customers, notifying them of a data security incident that might have impacted some of their sensitive personal and financial information. PlanetDrugsDirect is an active Canadian International Pharmacy Association member, and association of licensed, retail pharmacies that sell medication to Canadian and U.S. citizens, and more. PlanetDrugsDirect describes itself as an "Online prescription referral service which provides our customers with direct access to affordable prescription and non-prescription medications" with roughly 400,000 customers. The Canadian online prescription referral service informed a yet unknown number of customers via email of a recent data security incident that may have impacted some of their data. "Our investigation to date indicates that your exposed data may include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, medical information including prescription(s), and payment information," PlanetDrugsDirect says in the breach notification. PlanetDrugsDirect's site says that the online pharmacy collects several types of personal, financial, and medical information "Necessary for providing service and arranging to fill your orders through our contracted pharmacies and government approved dispensaries." BleepingComputer confirmed the security incident after calling PlanetDrugsDirect's call center to ask for more details.
