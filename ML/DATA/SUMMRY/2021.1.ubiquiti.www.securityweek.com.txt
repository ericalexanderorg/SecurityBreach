American technology company Ubiquiti this week revealed that one of its third-party cloud providers suffered a data breach. Founded in 2005, the New York City-based company manufactures wired and wireless data communication products for both corporate and home users, including routers, security cameras, network video recorders, and other Internet of Things devices. "We recently became aware of unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems hosted by a third party cloud provider. We have no indication that there has been unauthorized activity with respect to any user's account," Ubiquiti said in a notification published on Monday. Ubiquiti says, it's still possible that user data might have been exposed in the breach. If exposed, may include names and email addresses, along with encrypted passwords to accounts, along with addresses and phone numbers. Ubiquiti encourages users to change their passwords, as a precautionary measure. "We recommend that you also change your password on any website where you use the same user ID or password. Finally, we recommend that you enable two-factor authentication on your Ubiquiti accounts if you have not already done so," the company says.
