A hacker published documents containing Social Security numbers, student grades and other private information stolen from a large public-school district in Las Vegas after officials refused a ransom demanded in return for unlocking district computer servers. The illegal release late last week of sensitive information from the Clark County School District in Las Vegas, with about 320,000 students, demonstrates an escalation in tactics for hackers who have taken advantage of schools heavily reliant on online learning and technology to run operations during the coronavirus pandemic. Hackers have attacked school districts and other institutions with sensitive information even before the pandemic, typically blocking users' access to their own computer systems unless a ransom is paid. In those instances, the so-called ransomware crippled the district's operations but hackers didn't usually expose damaging information about students or employees. Consultants often advise districts that hackers generally have a good record of releasing control of the servers upon payment to entice others to pay in the future. On Sept. 14, the hacker sent Clark County a warning by releasing on its website a file of stolen district information that looked to be nonsensitive, said Mr. Callow, who could see what the hacker had posted. In Texas, the 10,000-student Sheldon Independent School District in Houston paid $206,931 in bitcoin from its reserve fund after being hacked in March, from an initial ransom amount of about $350,000, district officials said.
