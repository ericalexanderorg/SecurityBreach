Norwegian company Visma, who was targeted in the attack, and U.S. company Rapid7 provided support and extensive expertise throughout this research. The attackers then enumerated access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert on APT10 to deliver malware. On the two other victim networks, the attackers deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10. In early 2017, APT10 began conducting attacks against global managed IT service providers that granted them unprecedented access to MSPs and their customers' networks. We were particularly interested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were subsequently compromised by APT10, given their potential access through compromised MSP networks. After almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers used their access to the network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20-encrypted variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading technique. Once on the Visma network, APT10 attackers used the Microsoft BITSAdmin CLI tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled C2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the ProgramDatatemp directory on the infected host.
