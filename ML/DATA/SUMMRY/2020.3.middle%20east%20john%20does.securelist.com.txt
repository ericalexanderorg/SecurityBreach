Configuration data Base64-encoded JSON data in PE resources. Encryption The communication encryption used is RC4 with the 64-byte key stored in the configuration data. The main malicious functions are implemented in a separate thread. Milum decodes its configuration data and, besides timeouts, it gets the parameters "Clientid" and "Encrypt key" to use in RC4 encryption. Then the Trojan will create the C:ProgramDataMicappWindows directory and parse its configuration data to form the beacon to send to its C2. To send the beacon, Milum uses the HTTP POST request with three parameters as enumerated in the table below. Beacon parameter Parameter values md Clientid from config, with prefix 01011 and random five-character ASCII suffix nk Key from config to communicate with C2, differs for each server val Compressed, encrypted and encoded command JSON data. According to our telemetry, the Milum Trojan was exclusively used to attack targets in the Middle East from at least the end of May 2019. Their C++ code is quite common, regarding configuration data and communication protocol malware uses base64-encoded JSON-formatted configuration data stored in the binary's resource section and parses it with Standard Template Library functions.
