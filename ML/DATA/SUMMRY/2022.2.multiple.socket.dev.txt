The proverb "Crime doesn't pay" might need an update, as the NCA reports reveal LockBit's total money stolen could be in excess of $1,000,000,000 from July, 2022 - February, 2024. Their analysis showed over 2,200 BTC left unspent in excess of ~Â£90M. The NCA concluded that the impact of LockBit's ransomware attacks over its four years in operation is "In the region of multi-billions of dollars," given that the crypto funds represent a combination of both the victim and LockBit payments, which is customarily a 20% fee paid by affiliates. This did not take into account the actual ransom totals being far greater than what LockBit leadership had socked away. In just 18 months, LockBit and its affiliates elevated ransomware operations to unprecedented levels, allegedly raking in billions and informally earning the gang "Cyber crime unicorn" status after vx-underground shared the group's financial information on X. According to stats from Malwarebytes Labs, LockBit was responsible for the lion's share of known ransomware attacks in January 2024, with the vast majority affecting organizations in the USA and Europe. The U.S. Department of State is offering a $15 million bounty for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of LockBit affiliates and identification of the group's leaders. Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro, in collaboration with the NCA, released a report detailing a new development version of LockBit that they believe "Could form the basis of a LockBit 4.0:". The report also noted that LockBit had experienced "a number of logistical, technical, and reputational problems," forcing them to work on a new version of their ransomware but they were delayed in getting it to market due to continued technical issues.
