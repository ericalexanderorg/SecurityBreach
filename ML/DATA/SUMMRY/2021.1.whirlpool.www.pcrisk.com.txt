Whirlpool has since confirmed the attack but has stated that they have recovered from the attack. "We live in a time when Illegal cyber crimes are all too prevalent across every industry. Data privacy is a top priority at Whirlpool Corporation and we invest in the technology and processes to help protect our people, our data and our operations.
