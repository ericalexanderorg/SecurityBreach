Honda has said it is dealing with a cyber-attack that is impacting its operations around the world. "Honda can confirm that a cyber-attack has taken place on the Honda network," the Japanese car-maker said in a statement. "There is also an impact on production systems outside of Japan," it added. Honda currently runs a factory in Swindon, where it makes its Civic cars, which is due to close in 2021. Some cyber-security experts have said it looks like a ransomware attack, which means that hackers might have encrypted data or locked Honda out of some of its IT systems. The company has insisted no data has been breached and added that "At this point, we see minimal business impact". Honda employs nearly 220,000 people worldwide across more than 400 group affiliate companies.
