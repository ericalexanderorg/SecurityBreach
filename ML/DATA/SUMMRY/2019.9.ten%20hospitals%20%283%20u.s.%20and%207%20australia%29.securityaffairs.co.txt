A new wave of ransomware attacks hit US and Australian hospitals and health service providers causing the paralysis of their systems. Several hospitals and health service providers from the U.S. and Australia were hit by ransomware attacks that forced the administrators to shut part of their IT infrastructure. "Ten hospitals-three in Alabama and seven in Australia-have been hit with paralyzing ransomware attacks that are affecting their ability to take new patients, it was widely reported on Tuesday." reported ArsTechnica. "All three hospitals that make up the DCH Health System in Alabama were closed to new patients on Tuesday as officials there coped with an attack that paralyzed the health network's computer system." "The cyber incident, which was uncovered on Monday, has blocked access to several systems by the infiltration of ransomware, including financial management. Hospitals have isolated and disconnected a number of systems such as internet to quarantine the infection." A couple of weeks ago, the Campbell County Memorial Hospital in Gilette, Wyoming was hit by a ransomware attack on its computer systems that caused service disruptions. The list of ransomware attacks is long and includes schools in Louisiana and Alabama.
