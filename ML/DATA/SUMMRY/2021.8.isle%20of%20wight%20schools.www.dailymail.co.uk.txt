Hackers have targeted the private computer systems of six schools on the Isle of Wight. A so-called 'ransomware' attack crippled the servers of the Island Education Federation. Such attacks use a computer virus that when downloaded can encrypt data, with cybercriminals demanding money to restore the systems. The IT systems were compromised between July 28 and 29 and affected three primary schools, two secondary schools and a sixth form college. A spokesman for the group said: 'We are working with officers from the police cybercrime unit to pursue the cyber criminals and understand the full impact of the attack. It was the fourth attack on school trusts that month. A statement said: 'Having spoken to our service provider, we understand that the attack means that all the information that we stored with them has been encrypted.
