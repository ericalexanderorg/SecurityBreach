Here's what you need to know about the Ticketmaster breach and how to keep yourself safe from other major corporate breaches in the future. A cyber breach hacker group known as ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for stealing information including full names, addresses, phone numbers and even payment data of over 500 million customers. As of now, Ticketmaster has not provided specific details on how it is addressing this particular breach. With half a billion people impacted by this breach - and, without Ticketmaster doing much about it yet - you might be wondering whether or not your information was in there. Check for notifications: Keep an eye out for any official communication from Ticketmaster, which should inform you if your data was compromised. Ticketmaster is not the first major company to have a data breach this year, and it's likely not the last. Due to the fact that Ticketmaster has disappointed many of its customers already, this might be the last straw for millions of them.
