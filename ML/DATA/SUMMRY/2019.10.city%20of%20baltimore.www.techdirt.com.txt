The City of Baltimore was hit with a ransomware attack in May of this year. City council members alleged a lack of transparency and communication in the wake of the incident, as well as an inability to maintain a functional organization "During an emergency event." He also also never drafted a continuity of operations plan for an IT attack of the kind that occurred. Given the fact that $6 million has already been pulled from parks and public utilities funds to "Harden" city systems, the $76,000 demand now seems like a bargain. This understatement brought the hearing to a halt as council members expressed their disbelief that city data was not being backed up. City data needed for an audit cannot be recovered because the IT department never made an effort to express the dangers of storing the only copy of data locally. Ars has requested information from the city regarding the contracting details for the recovery, but the city has thus far provided no data. The city figures it will cost $18 million to recover from a rejected $76,000 ransom demand.
