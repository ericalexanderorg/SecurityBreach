Volexity has subsequently been able to tie these attacks to multiple incidents it worked in late 2019 and 2020 at a US-based think tank. At one particular think tank, Volexity worked three separate incidents involving Dark Halo. In the initial incident, Volexity found multiple tools, backdoors, and malware implants that had allowed the attacker to remain undetected for several years. Volexity has worked three major incidents involving the Dark Halo threat actor. Toward the end of the second incident that Volexity worked involving Dark Halo, the actor was observed accessing the e-mail account of a user via OWA. This was unexpected for a few reasons, not least of which was the targeted mailbox was protected by MFA. Logs from the Exchange server showed that the attacker provided username and password authentication like normal but were not challenged for a second factor through Duo. At the time of the investigation, Volexity deduced that the likely infection was the result of the SolarWinds box on the target network; however, it was not fully understood exactly how the breach occurred, therefore Volexity was not in a position to report the circumstances surrounding the breach to SolarWinds. Generally, the attacker displayed a reasonable level of operational security throughout the attack, taking steps to wipe logs for various services used and to remove evidence of their commands from infected systems.
