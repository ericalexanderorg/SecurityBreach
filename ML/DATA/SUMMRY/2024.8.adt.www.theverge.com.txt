Security company ADT disclosed in an SEC filing that hackers obtained "Some limited customer information, including email addresses, phone numbers and postal addresses." TechCrunch reports that ADT's disclosure follows a seller on a cybercrime forum claiming last week that they had obtained more than 30,000 stolen ADT customer records. The hackers obtained the information by accessing "Certain databases containing ADT customer order information," according to ADT. The company believes that only a "Small percentage" of its subscribers were affected and says it has notified those customers. ADT says that it has "No reason to believe" that the hackers compromised home security systems and that credit card data and banking information weren't taken. "Our customers' privacy and security is our utmost priority, and we have taken several steps to help keep their information safe, including immediately activating rigorous cybersecurity protocols," ADT spokesperson Ben Tamblyn says in a statement. ADT Inc. recently experienced a cybersecurity incident during which unauthorized actors illegally accessed certain databases containing ADT customer order information. Based on its investigation to date, the Company has no reason to believe that customers' home security systems were compromised during this incident. The Company has no reason to believe the attackers obtained other personally sensitive information such as credit card data or banking information.
