Two weeks after a cyber-security firm released the identity of an alleged hacker from Kazakhstan, federal authorities in Seattle on Tuesday unsealed a 2018 indictment charging the man with an array of computer crimes. Rey Turchin, known in hacking circles as "Fxmsp," and his accomplices ran a prolific hacking ring that attacked hundreds of victims, including government agencies, schools, banks and luxury hotel chains on six continents, the indictment said. Turchin, 37, is believed to be in Kazakhstan; prosecutors had kept the indictment sealed to avoid tipping him off that he was being sought. In a motion to unseal the charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle wrote that they now believe Turchin knows about the criminal investigation and, given the security firm's public identification of him, there was little reason to keep the indictment sealed. The Singapore-based cyber-security firm Group-IB, which has previously cooperated with international law enforcement agencies, published a report last month on fxmsp's activities, identifying the hacker as Turchin. Among the victims was a port authority in Cowlitz County, Washington - the Port of Longview announced that it had been the victim of a major hack in 2018 - as well as a petroleum products company in Alaska, an airline based in New York, a software developer in California, a Colorado law firm and an African bank, the indictment said. Turchin faces five criminal counts, including conspiracy to commit computer hacking, computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and access device fraud.
