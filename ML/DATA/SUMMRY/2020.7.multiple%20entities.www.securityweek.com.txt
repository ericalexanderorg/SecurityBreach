The United States Department of Justice on Tuesday announced charges against two individuals for the hacking of hundreds of organizations worldwide, including governments and COVID-19 responders. The two, Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, both nationals and residents of China, are accused to have conducted computer intrusion activities on behalf of the Chinese government for more than 10 years. Victims of the two include governments, non-governmental organizations, companies, human rights activists, clergy, and dissidents in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and more. The indictment alleges that the two conspired to steal trade secrets from eight victims, including manufacturing processes, pharmaceutical chemical structures, source code, technology designs, and test mechanisms and results. The hackers allegedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of secrets, intellectual property, and other data, and even attempted to extort at least one of the victims, threatening to make the stolen information public unless a ransom was paid. The indictment, which provides further details on when and what type of data was stolen from specific organizations, also accuses the two of placing web shells on victim networks, and of frequently using the China Chopper web shell - the tool is popular among Chinese hackers - to maintain access to the compromised environments. "China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.
