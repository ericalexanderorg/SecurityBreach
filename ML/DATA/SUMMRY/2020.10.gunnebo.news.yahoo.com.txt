STOCKHOLM - Swedish security firm Gunnebo said on Tuesday it was in contact with customers after hackers had released sensitive information about their accounts after its system was compromised two months ago. Gunnebo said in August that it had reported an attack against its servers to the Swedish Security Service, after external IT-forensics had concluded that the attack was well organised. Three security experts told Reuters that large amounts of leaked data was available for download on the dark web in a 18-gigabyte file, after Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter first reported on Tuesday that information had been released by hackers. DN said data released included information about security measures for the Swedish parliament. One page hosting the download link to the leaked data put up by hackers and seen by Reuters showed a summary of the content, which included details on Gunnebo's financial information, banking details and passwords and details of customer transactions. The hackers had 38,000 files from the Swedish company, with information about customers worldwide, including the protection of the Swedish parliament and drawings of bank vaults, DN reported https://www. "We are going through the material now and in those cases where information is sensitive we make contact with the customer," Syren told DN. Gunnebo is currently fielding a bid from investment company Stena Adactum and private equity firm Altor that values Gunnebo at around 2.4 billion Swedish crowns.
