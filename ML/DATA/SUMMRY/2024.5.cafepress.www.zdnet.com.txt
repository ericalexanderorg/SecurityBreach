CafePress's past owner has been fined $500,000 over a litany of security failures and data breaches. CafePress became the subject of a US Federal Trade Commission investigation surrounding how it handled security - and how the firm allegedly "Failed to secure consumers' sensitive personal data and covered up a major breach." According to the FTC's complaint, issued against the platform's former owner Residual Pumpkin Entity, LLC, and its current owner PlanetArt, LLC, there was a lack of "Reasonable security measures" to prevent data breaches. The FTC claims that CafePress kept user data for longer than necessary, stored personally identifiable information including Social Security numbers and password reset answers in cleartext, and did not patch against known system vulnerabilities. "As a result of its shoddy security practices, CafePress' network was breached multiple times," the FTC says. According to the FTC, CafePress was notified a month after the breach and did patch the security flaw - but did not investigate the breach properly "For several months." Both companies will have to hire third-party experts to perform security audits and must redress any existing security issues - including replacing security questions with multi-factor authentication processes, encrypting Social Security numbers, and tightening up their data storage and retention practices.
