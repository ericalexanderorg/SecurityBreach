Approximately 2,000 Robinhood accounts were accessed by hackers and looted during the week of October 5, according to Bloomberg﻿﻿. Victims told Bloomberg that their trading accounts were hacked in spite of already having set up account protection. A Robinhood spokesperson tells us, "A limited number of customers appear to have had their Robinhood account targeted by cybercriminals because of their personal email account being compromised outside of Robinhood. We're actively working with those impacted to secure their accounts. This was not stemming from a breach of Robinhood's systems." Because of an increase in cybercrime that has been observed across the financial industry during the pandemic, and in an effort to help customers protect their accounts, Robinhood has been advising customers via push notifications related to recommended account security actions, to set up two-factor authentication, verify their personal information, and use strong password practices. The spokesperson says, "Whenever we are made aware of account issues we work directly with customers to resolve any issues as quickly as possible." The Robinhood spokesperson states, "If we determine through our investigation that the customer has sustained losses because of unauthorized activity, we will compensate the customer fully for those losses." More seriously, Robinhood also lacks some of the security measures that are in place at most other brokers, such as verifying changes in bank account links. One of the reasons so many of the hacked accounts were drained involved hackers adding a new bank account to a funded account, and allowing funds to be transferred to the new account without additional verification.
