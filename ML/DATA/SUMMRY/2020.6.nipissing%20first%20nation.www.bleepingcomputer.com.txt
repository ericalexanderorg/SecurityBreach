The Nipissing First Nation administration stopped a ransomware attack in its tracks but not soon enough to prevent disruption of communications. Nipissing First Nation is an urban reserve with 11 communities spread on the shore of Lake Nipissing. Even with its small population, the NFN administration was not spared by ransomware, showing that the attackers only care about getting paid. "NFN staff interrupted the attack once discovered and immediately shut down all servers, discontinued remote access" - Nipissing First Nation administration. For a long time, ransomware attacks were not considered as data breaches. The ransomware family targeting NFN has not been disclosed publicly, so it is unclear if the attackers are among those leaking victim data or not. In December 2019, the computer network of North Carolina Native American tribe was the victims of a ransomware attack, too.
