Nasdaq-listed U.S. laser company IP Photonics Corp. has been hit by a ransomware attack that shut down saw its information technology systems worldwide. First reported Friday by Bleeping Computer, the ransomware attack involved the RansomExx strain of ransomware, sometimes also dubbed Ransom X. RansomExx was first detected in July when Japanese technology company Konica Minolta Inc. was attacked and its services knocked offline for about a week. As with the Konica Minolta attack, the ransom demand against IP Photonics included a message stating that law enforcement should not be contacted because ransom payments could be blocked. The attack on IP Photonics has U.S. national security implications. IP Photonics is a major developer of laser warfare technology and its technology has been deployed by the U.S. Navy on the USS Ponce. "The ransomware attack against IPG Photonics highlights a concerning trend," Andrea Carcano, co-founder of operational technology and internet of things security company Nozomi Networks Inc., told SiliconANGLE. "Attackers are demanding higher ransoms and targeting larger and more critical organizations. These threats should be a serious concern for security professionals responsible for keeping not only IT, but OT and IoT networks safe." "It is never advisable to pay the ransom, and organizations that give in to the hackers' demands are only fueling the profitability of the ransomware industry for attackers."
