At-home laboratory services provider Apex Laboratory said hackers stole some patient data during a ransomware attack that took place several months ago. "However, on December 15, 2020, Apex learned that the hackers posted information on their blog about the attack and listed data taken that contained personal and health information for some patients," the company revealed. While looking into the attackers' claims, Apex discovered that the data might have been stolen from its systems between July 21 and July 25, 2020. The medical services provider says that, for some of its patients, stolen data includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and test results. "Additionally, Apex is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of any information other than the extracting of this data as part of the cyber-attack," the company said. In addition to data on hundreds of patients, employee information was also stolen in the incident, it appears. In its data breach notification, Apex Laboratory said it "Ensured that the data was removed from the hacker's blog," without providing further details on whether that involved paying the attackers or whether the hackers continue to be in the possession of stolen data.
