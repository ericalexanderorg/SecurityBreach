Hammersmith Medicines Research LTD, a research company on standby to perform live trials of Coronavirus vaccines, has started emailing data breach notifications after having their data stolen and published in a ransomware attack. This attack occurred on March 14th, 2020, when the Maze Ransomware operators stole data hosted on HMR's network and then began to encrypt their computers. After the ransom was not paid, the Maze operators published some of the stolen data on their "News" site on March 21st to further extort HMR into making a payment. According to HMR's data breach notification, the stolen records contained the personal information for volunteers who surnames begin with D, G, I, or J. "We're sorry to report that, during 21-23 March 2020, the criminals published on their website records from some of our volunteers' screening visits. The website is not visible on the public web, and those records have since been taken down. The records were from some of our volunteers with surnames beginning with D, G, I or J.". On March 18th, BleepingComputer contacted numerous ransomware operators and asked if they would attack hospitals and health care organizations during the Coronavirus pandemic. Four of the ransomware operators, including Maze, Clop, DoppelPaymer, and Nefilim, stated that they would not target hospitals and medical organizations during the pandemic and would decrypt any that are accidentally encrypted. To assist these organizations, Microsoft has started to proactively contact hospitals and healthcare organizations that are using publicly accessible VPN and gateway devices with known vulnerabilities targeted by ransomware.
