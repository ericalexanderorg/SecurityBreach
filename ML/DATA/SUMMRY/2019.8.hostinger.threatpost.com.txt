Web hosting company Hostinger is warning that a breach of one of its servers potentially gave bad actors access to the hashed passwords and personal data of more than 14 million customers. Hostinger, a popular web, cloud and virtual private server hosting provider and domain registrar with 29 million+ users, has notified customers that it has reset all passwords after the unauthorized third party gained access to an internal system API server. The server contained hashed passwords and other non-financial data about customers. "Immediately following the security incident, all Hostinger user passwords have been reset using SHA-256 hashing algorithm," a Hostinger spokesperson told Threatpost. While Hostinger has reset impacted customer passwords, security experts are urging anyone impacted to ensure that their potentially compromised passwords aren't being re-used elsewhere - an issue that still affects hundreds of thousands of internet users, a recent Google study found. "When password hashes are copied, the risk is that an attacker will be able to crack those passwords and then use the information to authenticate to the compromised service, or to other services where those passwords are used," he said. Justin Fox, director of DevOps Engineering for NuData Security, added that enabling multi-factor authentication is a good way for service providers to mitigate the risk of a compromised password.
