This week we received an emergency lockdown request from a client who had been attacked and was dealing with multiple account compromises as a result. The attacker does not merely have access to your phone calls and text messages which can be used to man-in-the-middle account reset requests, they have your phone and all of the sensitive information it contains. The attacker managed to get a small amount of bitcoin out of one of our client's exchange accounts. Since the attacker only had 1 of the client's 5 keys to his Casa multisig, those funds could not be spent. While a regular wrench attacker employs physical pain or the threat thereof, with this attack your compliance is compelled via drugs. It's worth reviewing our previous guidance on wrench attacks because it applies 100%. The major takeaway for protecting your funds from this type of attack is ensuring that you do not have immediate access to a signing threshold of key material that can be used to spend the funds. Physical attacks are still quite rare in comparison to digital attacks.
