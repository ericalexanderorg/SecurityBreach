Updated 1/17/23 at 8:00 p.m. ET: At Mailchimp, we take the security of our users' data seriously, and we want to keep you informed about a recent security incident. On January 11, the Mailchimp Security team identified an unauthorized actor accessing one of our tools used by Mailchimp customer-facing teams for customer support and account administration. The unauthorized actor conducted a social engineering attack on Mailchimp employees and contractors, and obtained access to select Mailchimp accounts using employee credentials compromised in that attack. Based on our investigation to date, this targeted incident has been limited to 133 Mailchimp accounts. After we identified evidence of an unauthorized actor, we temporarily suspended account access for Mailchimp accounts where we detected suspicious activity to protect our users' data. We've been working with our users directly to help them reinstate their accounts, answer questions, and provide any additional support they need. We are continuing our investigation and will be providing impacted account holders with timely and accurate information throughout the process.
