Codecov Security EventOn April 15, 2021, Codecov publicly disclosed a security event during which an unauthorized party was able to make modifications to a Codecov component that Codecov customers download and execute when using the solution. On investigation, HashiCorp found that a subset of HashiCorp CI pipelines used the affected Codecov component. Exposure of HashiCorp GPG KeyThe GPG private key used for signing hashes used to validate HashiCorp product downloads was exposed. MacOS code signing/notarization and Windows AuthentiCode signing of HashiCorp releases for those platforms were unaffected by the exposed GPG key in question. HashiCorp will publish patch releases of Terraform and related tooling which will update the automatic verification code to use the new GPG key. HashiCorp Customer ImpactIn general, customers should ensure that they download HashiCorp products only from the official release channel accessible directly at https://releases. In customer environments where HashiCorp product downloads are manually or automatically validated using the SHA256SUM files and associated signatures, process or configuration updates may be necessary to reflect the change in HashiCorp's GPG key.
