Currency data provider Open Exchange Rates has started informing customers that their information was likely stolen by hackers. Open Exchange Rates provides a currency data API that is used by over 80,000 web developers. The attacker then used that key to access Open Exchange Rates' network, including a database storing user data. Open Exchange Rates said the database contained information such as name, email address, hashed account passwords, IP address, app ID, and, where provided, personal and business name and address, country of residence, and website address. "There is no evidence to suggest that information relating to you was specifically targeted during the incident. However, our investigations have found that some of your information is contained in this database and therefore would have been accessible to the unauthorized third party," Open Exchange Rates told customers. In response to the incident, the company has reset all user passwords and customers have been advised to generate new app IDs, which are used to query exchange rate information from the service. "Our AWS architecture has been designed according to the best practices for secure, high-availability services. This was a sophisticated attack, made possible by a data security breach at a third-party supplier, and we deeply regret that a compromised access key was able to facilitate unauthorised access in this way, resulting in the first security incident in our 8-year history," the firm said.
