The German cruise line AIDA Cruises had to cancel recent cruises for New Year Eve due to some "IT restrictions". Recently, the German operator AIDA Cruises has faced service disruptions. While AIDA didn't reveal many details, German media reports that the cruise line has suffered a cyber attack. According to a Cruise Law News report, AIDA has possibly suffered a ransomware attack. What they are not telling is that the actual cause behind this issue is a cyber attack on the networks of AIDA cruises. AIDA Cruises started off in 1960 as a German shipping firm until its acquisition by the British-American giant Carnival Corporation. Presently, it's controlled by a Carnival Corporation & plc company Costa Cruise Group.
