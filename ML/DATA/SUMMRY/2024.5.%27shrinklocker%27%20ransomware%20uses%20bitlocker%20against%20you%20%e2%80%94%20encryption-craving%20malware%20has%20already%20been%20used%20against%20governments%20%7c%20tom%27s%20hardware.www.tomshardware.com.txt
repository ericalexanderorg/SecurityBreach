The attack uses novel methods to make a classic BitLocker attack more pervasive and dangerous than ever before, and it has already been used against governments and manufacturing industries. Kaspersky, known for its Kaspersky Anti-Virus and class-leading malware research, identified the new strain in Mexico, Indonesia, and Jordan, so far only against enterprise PCs. Attacks using BitLocker, an optional Windows feature that encrypts PC hard drives commonly used in the enterprise world, are not new. The script creates a new random 64-character encryption key, sends it and other information about the computer to the attacker, deletes the logs that stored ShrinkLocker's activity, and finally forces a shut-down of the PC, using the newly created boot partition to fully lock and encrypt all drives on the PC. The PC and every byte of data on it is now fully unusable. The creator of the ShrinkLocker attack must have had an "Extensive understanding" of a variety of obscure Windows internals and utilities to craft the attack, which left almost no trace. For a ransomware attack, the attacker also did not make it easy to find where to send the ransom in question. IT professionals will already be familiar with mitigation steps for these attacks: Make frequent backups, restrict users' editing privileges so they cannot edit their BitLocker settings or registries, and seek out high-level EPP or MDR solutions to track and secure your network. While BitLocker is currently only a feature of "Pro" or enterprise Windows releases, Microsoft will enable BitLocker for all users starting with Windows 11 24H2, and automatically activate it on reinstallation, so beware of BitLocker attacks making a move to the individual PC world.
