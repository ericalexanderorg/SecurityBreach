Japanese aerospace company Kawasaki Heavy Industries on Monday warned of a security incident that may have led to unauthorized access of customer data. According to the company's data breach notification, it first discovered unauthorized parties accessing a server in Japan, from an overseas office in Thailand, on June 11, 2020. Of note, while Kawasaki said that "Some information from overseas offices may have been leaked to external parties," the company has not yet found evidence of leaking information to the external network. "Because Kawasaki handles important sensitive information such as personal information and social infrastructure-related information, information security measures have been a top priority for the company," said the company's data breach notice, posted on its website [PDF]. Kawasaki has at least 34,000 employees across Japan, Asia, the Americas and Europe, as well as various subsidiaries, including Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle. While the incident was first discovered in June, "Due to the fact that the scope of unauthorized access spanned multiple domestic and overseas offices, it took a considerable amount of time until the company can formally announce the incident," according to the company. Following an unauthorized access from an overseas office in the United States, on July 8, Kawasaki added "Additional restriction" to all overseas network connections.
