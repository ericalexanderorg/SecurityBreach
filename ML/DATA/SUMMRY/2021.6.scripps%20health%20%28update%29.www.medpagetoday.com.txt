Like many other healthcare systems besieged by ransomware attacks and their repercussions, Scripps Health of San Diego is facing two class-action lawsuits from plaintiffs who claim the five-hospital system's leaders were negligent in failing to secure patient data against breaches. According to a letter that Scripps Health reportedly sent to 147,267 potentially affected patients, the breach began when an "Unauthorized person gained access to our network, deployed malware, and, on April 29, 2021," acquired some documents maintained by the Scripps system. "Upon conducting a review of those documents, we determined that one or more files may have reflected your name, address, date of birth, health insurance information, medical record number, patient account number, and/or clinical information, such as physician name, date(s) of service, and/or treatment information," the letter continued, according to its filing with the California Office of the Attorney General. The latest lawsuit filed June 7 in San Diego County Superior Court on behalf of patient Johnny Corning asserted that because there have been so many "High-profile data breaches" involving millions of patients within the last 2 years, Scripps Health "Knew or should have known that its electronic records would likely be targeted by cyber-criminals," but "Failed to take appropriate steps" to keep patients' protected health information from being compromised. Another lawsuit filed June 1 on behalf of Kenneth Garcia and 174,000 other patients believed to have been impacted by the breach alleged that medical history, mental and/or physical condition or treatment, including diagnosis and treatment dates, and other personal information were kept on the Scripps Health computer network "In a non-encrypted form." Scripps Health is a $2.9-billion private, nonprofit system with 3,000 physicians and five hospitals that treat 700,000 patients a year and provides roughly one-third of patient care in the region. Cyber-criminals have attacked multiple hospitals and health information systems in the last 2 years, and lawsuits have subsequently been filed against many of them, including Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey; BJC Health System in St. Louis; DCH Health System in Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Rady Children's Hospital, also in San Diego.
