R1 RCM Inc. [NASDAQ:RCM], one of the nation's largest medical debt collection companies, has been hit in a ransomware attack. R1 RCM acknowledged taking down its systems in response to a ransomware attack, but otherwise declined to comment for this story. The company has access to a wealth of personal, financial and medical information on tens of millions of patients, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing information and medical diagnostic data. R1 RCM declined to discuss the strain of ransomware it is battling or how it was compromised. Email security company Proofpoint says the Defray ransomware is somewhat unusual in that it is typically deployed in small, targeted attacks as opposed to large-scale "Spray and pray" email malware campaigns. A recent report from Corvus Insurance notes that ransomware attacks on companies in the healthcare industry have slowed in recent months, with some malware groups even dubiously pledging they would refrain from targeting these firms during the COVID-19 pandemic.
