More than 100 smart-irrigation systems deployed across the globe were installed without changing the factory's default, passwordless setting, leaving them vulnerable to malicious attacks, according to recent findings from Israeli security research firm Security Joes. The researchers immediately alerted CERT Israel, the affected companies and the irrigation system vendor, Mottech Water Management, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Threatpost. Recently, its researchers discovered that 55 irrigation systems within Israel were visible on the open internet without password protections. There's good reason for alarm about water systems not being secured, particularly in Israel. The irrigation systems which were discovered without password protection aren't related to the previous attacks, Naor said. Last month, six critical flaws in CodeMeter, software used to power industrial systems in the U.S., including water and electric utilities, were discovered which could be exploited to launch attacks or even allow third-party takeovers of systems. Operators need to take security seriously, he added, noting that two-factor authentication should be a bare minimum requirement for accessing these systems from a mobile device.
