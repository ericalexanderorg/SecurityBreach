On Friday, researchers revealed the discovery of a backdoor that was intentionally planted in xz Utils, an open-source data compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Xz Utils provides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all kinds of all kinds of operations. Through a combination of sheer luck and Freund's careful eye, he eventually discovered the problems were the result of updates that had been made to xz Utils. Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions when performing operations related to lzma compression or decompression. The following year, JiaT75 submited a patch over the xz Utils mailing list, and almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar joined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of xz Utils, hadn't been updating the software often or fast enough. In the months following, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in xz Utils affairs. At the moment, extremely little, especially for someone entrusted to steward a piece of software as ubiquitous and as sensitive as xz Utils.
