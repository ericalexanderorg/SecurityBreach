The recent cyberattack at the Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority inflicted damage that lasted months and threatened to cause a "Public health crisis," the agency said. Officials from Jersey City and the autonomous utilities agency have said little about the Sept. 30 ransomware attack, which MUA documents said blocked access to "Vital" water and sewer information. The attack caused the agency to "Lose access to vital information and documentation related to the provision of water and sewerage services to the citizens of the City of Jersey City," an October resolution reads. The Dec. 17 resolution also revealed the occurrence of another, previously unknown cyberattack on a different city agency: the Jersey City Office of Emergency Management. A city spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions about the incidents. Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop has made a point of highlighting Jersey City's cyberdefenses. A city spokeswoman subsequently noted the MUA's computer system is separate from the city's system.
