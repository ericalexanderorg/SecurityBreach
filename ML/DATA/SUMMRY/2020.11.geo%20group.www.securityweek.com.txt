Florida-based private prison operator GEO Group this week revealed that it was recently targeted in a cyberattack that involved ransomware and which may have resulted in the theft of sensitive information. The GEO Group operates over 120 jails, rehabilitation facilities, processing centers, and community reentry centers in North America, the UK, Australia and South Africa. The company revealed on November 3 that it discovered a data breach on August 19. Once the breach was detected, the company rushed to cut off all connections between the compromised corporate servers and facilities, data centers and the corporate office. GEO says it's not aware of any cases of fraud or misuse of personal information resulting from this breach. GEO said in the SEC filing that the incident impacted a "Portion" of its technology systems and a "Limited amount of data that contained personally identifiable information and protected health information." "The Company recovered its critical operating data and the incident has not had a significant impact on the Company's business operations or its ability to perform the services required under GEO's contracts with its government customers to care for the individuals entrusted to GEO's facilities and programs," GEO said.
