A former Yahoo! employee who admitted to hacking into the accounts of thousands of users was sentenced last week to five years of probation. The man, Reyes Daniel Ruiz, 35, of Tracy, California, pleaded guilty in September 2019 to hacking roughly 6,000 Yahoo! accounts, looking for sexual photos and videos. To access the victim accounts, he used cracked user passwords, but in some cases he abused internal Yahoo! systems for unauthorized access to accounts. In his guilty plea, Ruiz admitted to mainly targeting the accounts of younger women, friends, and even colleagues. After accessing the accounts, he made copies of the discovered content and stored it at his home. Ruiz, who has no criminal history, also admitted to targeting the Facebook, Gmail, iCloud, Dropbox, Hotmail, and other online accounts of victims. During his five years of probation, Ruiz is allowed to leave home for "Verified employment, medical needs and religious services," court records reveal.
