Earlier this year, Prevailion's security researchers identified a TA505 campaign targeting German companies with fake job application emails, but the attacks appear to have started in June 2019, or even the month before. Through the use of legitimate tools that are unlikely to be removed by traditional security software, the attackers can perform a broad range of activities, such as stealing files, capturing screens, and even recording audio. The security researchers discovered that the June 2019 attacks also included a ransomware component and included GPG suite files. The infrastructure in these attacks overlaps with that used in a set of attacks observed in February 2020, suggesting that the same threat actor is behind both. The new attacks employ a loader apparently called rekt, which was designed to contact Google Drive to download additional files. The second-stage payload in these attacks was identified as the commercially available remote desktop software NetSupport. Some of the identified variants of the rekt loader are dated April 2019, and the researchers also discovered samples signed with a digital signature used to sign two FlawwedAmmy Trojans as well, and previously associated with TA505, suggesting that the actor is behind the new attacks.
