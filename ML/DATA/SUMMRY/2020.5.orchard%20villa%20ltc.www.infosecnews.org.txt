Ontario's Minister of Long-term Care Dr. Merrilee Fullerton reported a potential data breach at a Pickering, Ontario long-term care home on Saturday evening on Twitter. "I'm learning of disturbing news out of Pickering's Orchard Villa LTC home. There is a possibility of a significant privacy breach regarding individual resident personal health info. My heart goes out to the residents and families, during what is already a very difficult time". Dr. Fullerton tweets "Our government takes personal privacy very seriously, and we are continuing to monitor this situation closely. I have been in contact with Peter Bethlenfalvy and we both share feelings of frustration and sadness at this recent development." "Orchard Villa has informed the Information Privacy Commissioner Office and other authorities as appropriate." The Pickering retirement community has been Ontario's hardest long-term care facility hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Friday, May 8th, 2020, there had been 68 deaths at Orchard Villa, with 63 in the long-term care section and five in the retirement home.
