Some security teams obtain lists of previously breached passwords that make their way online, scramble them in the same format that the company stores passwords, and find matches. We asked several follow-up questions - including who alerted StockX to the suspicious activity, if any customer data was compromised and why it misrepresented the reason for the password reset. Customers were given no prior warning of the password reset. StockX founder Josh Luber kept with the company's line, telling a customer in a tweet that the password reset was "Legit" but did not respond to users asking why. StockX tweeted back to several customers with a boilerplate response: "The password reset email you received is legitimate and came from our team," and to contact the support email with any questions. Security experts expressed doubt that a company would reset passwords over a "Systems update" as StockX had claimed. Several took to Twitter to criticize StockX for its handling of the password reset.
