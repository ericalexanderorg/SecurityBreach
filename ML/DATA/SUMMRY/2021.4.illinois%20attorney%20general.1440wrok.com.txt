If you're not familiar with the term "Ransomware," it's worth trying to get yourself up-to-speed, because ransomware is causing big problems here in the U.S. and around the world. Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their system, either by locking the system's screen or by locking the users' files until a ransom is paid. More modern ransomware families, collectively categorized as cryptoransomware, encrypt certain file types on infected systems and force users to pay the ransom through certain online payment methods to get a decryption key. The bottom line is that your computer or computer systems are locked up by the bad guys, and all your files, photos, and other things you need from that computer or computer system stay that way until you pay the bad guys the ransom demand. The bad guys might just disappear, leaving your computer/computer systems locked up and unavailable to you forever. On the morning of Saturday, April 10, the Attorney General's office discovered that the office's computer network had been compromised by a ransomware attack. The Attorney General's office began an immediate investigation and continues to work closely with law enforcement authorities to determine the extent of the compromise, what information was exposed, and what was done with the information on its system.
