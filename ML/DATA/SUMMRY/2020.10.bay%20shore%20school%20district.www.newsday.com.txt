A hacker attack has disrupted computer service for students and teachers in the Bay Shore school district - the second reported hit on a Long Island school system in the past week. In a message newly posted on Bay Shore's website, Superintendent Joseph Bond said the cyberattack was meant to flood the district's computer system, rather than stealing information. Technically, such assaults are known as Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS. A similar incident was reported in Lindenhurst's school district Monday. "This attack is similar to what some other local school districts have experienced in the last few weeks." In Lindenhurst, a cyberattack last week prevented teachers from livestreaming to remote students, according to a computer-networks firm executive who spoke for the district. Bay Shore and Lindenhurst are hardly the first districts struck by cybercriminals. Rockville Centre last year paid hackers $88,000, after a ransomware virus locked the district's computer files.
