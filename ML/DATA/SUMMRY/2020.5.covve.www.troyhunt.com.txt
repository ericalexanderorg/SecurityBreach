It's about a data breach with almost 90GB of personal information in it across tens of millions of records - including mine. Back in Feb, Dehashed reached out to me with a massive trove of data that had been left exposed on a major cloud provider via a publicly accessible Elasticsearch instance. My own data is there, anyone see any clues indicating the source? https://t. It's mostly scrapable data from public sources, albeit with some key differences. Nowhere - absolutely nowhere - was there any indication of where the data had originated from. Mark me down for another data breach of my own personal info. Only the presence of an address is searchable, the data associated with the address is not stored nor retrievable.
