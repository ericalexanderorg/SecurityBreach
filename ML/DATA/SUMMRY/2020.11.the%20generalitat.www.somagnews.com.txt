Cybercriminals take advantage of the current situation of uncertainty, the massive influx of Teleworking and any slightest flaw or loophole in a security program, exactly what has happened to the Generalitat of Catalonia. All for a computer security flaw in the form of vulnerability. A vulnerability can be exploited, in fact cybercriminals sometimes do not have to hack, but only take advantage of 'exploits' or security holes in the services, apps or platforms they want to steal. The Generalitat is currently investigating whether the data of 5,000 users has been stolen and is being used to hack them, and "As of today, we cannot conclude that the existence of this vulnerability has led to a cybersecurity incident." "But what exactly happened? According to the cybersecurity expert company Avast, it is a SQL Injection security flaw on which an investigation is being carried out. As Luis Corrons, Avast's 'Security Evangelist' points out, SQL injection attacks are quite common, and"have been used in many attacks over the years. To prevent them, in addition to taking security measures, when configuring and programming the databases, it is essential to carry out periodic audits of the security of computer systems. "An SQL injection attack can only give access to certain records, or in the worst case it can lead to a total compromise of the system where the database is located. The good thing about the case of the Generalitat is that it was a security researcher who found the problem and reported on the matter".
