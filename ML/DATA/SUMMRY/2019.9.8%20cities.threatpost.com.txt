A vulnerable municipality payment software, which previously led to the breach of hundreds of thousands of payment cards in 2017, has been targeted once again. The hack targets a flaw in Click2Gov software, which is used in self-service bill-paying portals used by utilities and community development organizations for things such as paying parking tickets online. Out of the eight cities impacted by this most recent breach, six already had systems that were previously compromised in the original breach. "Some of these victims resided in different states but remotely transacted with the Click2Gov portal in affected cities, potentially due to past travels or to owning property in those cities." Researchers contacted the eight towns, and while most did not respond, those that did confirmed a breach in their Click2Gov utility payment portals. Several towns took their Click2Gov portals offline shortly after contact. "The second wave of Click2Gov breaches indicates that despite patched systems, the portal remains vulnerable," they said.
