US-based hardware company MaxLinear has been targeted by a Maze ransomware attack. Threat actors gained unauthorized access to the company's systems between April 15 and May 24 and accessed the personal and financial details of its customers, the company said. Impacted systems were taken offline, and the company also enlisted the services of third-party cybersecurity. According to the letter, threat actors gained access to personal customer information, including names, personal and company email and mailing addresses, driver's license numbers, financial account information, Social Security numbers and more. The company has also implemented an organization-wide password. In June alone, Maze targeted numerous high-profile U.S.-based organizations, including the U.S. government and companies in the defense, aerospace and marine industries. After obtaining unauthorized access to the company's internal network, hackers encrypted its machines and pressured Westech into paying a fee by leaking confidential documents online.
