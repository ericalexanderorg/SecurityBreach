The outsourcing firm behind NHS Test and Trace has confirmed that it was targeted by cyber criminals operating the newly-discovered Babuk ransomware. Sky News, which first reported on the cyber attack, managed to obtain a confirmation from the company that Test and Trace was not affected in the incident. Speaking to Sky News, Serco spokesperson Marcus Deville said there had been "No impact on UK business" and that the attack had only impacted the company's mainland European operations, which were "Completely isolated" from those in the UK. The publication also found that the cyber criminals had used the Babuk ransomware in the attack, which had only gained notoriety in the last few weeks, with little information available. Ransomware resiliency: The risks associated with an attack and the reward of recovery planning. Kaspersky principal security researcher David Emm told IT Pro that Babuk is a "Fairly new ransomware". "It's also unclear what the attack vector is in this case, although such attacks typically employ social engineering - i.e. tricking staff into doing something that compromises security, such as clicking on an attachment or link in a message." According to the ransom note addressed to Serco, the cyber criminals had been "Surfing inside network for about three weeks and copied more than 1TB of your data".
