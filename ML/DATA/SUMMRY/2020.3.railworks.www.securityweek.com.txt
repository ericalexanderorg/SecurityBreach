Rail contractor RailWorks Corporation is notifying employees and third-parties that it recently fell victim to a ransomware attack in which sensitive information might have been compromised. The company has more than 3,500 employees in North America. At the end of January, the company started informing employees of a cyber-incident that resulted in servers and systems being encrypted, and has since filed data breach notifications with California's Office of the Attorney General. The incident, which the company refers to as a "Sophisticated cyberattack," was clearly a ransomware attack, where cybercriminals managed to compromise systems within the contractor's environment and plant data-encrypting malware on them. The affected machines, RailWorks explains in the breach notifications, might have contained personally identifiable information of its employees, former employees, and third-party contractors. The incident "May have involved access to your name, address, driver's license number and/or government issued ID, Social Security number, date of birth and date of hire/termination and/or retirement," the company told its employees. SecurityWeek has emailed RailWorks for additional information on the incident and will update the article as soon as a reply arrives.
