He says Binns asked him to contact AT&T "To facilitate a buyback of the data," and that "Given the importance of the data" and the potential for harm, "I felt an obligation to ensure he did not sell the data to anyone else." "Analysis of the data samples provided from other victims indicated that the hack of Ticketmaster occurred first," he tells WIRED. "From there, it seems the actors figured out they could target 'snowflakecomputing.com' domains by looking for stolen credentials. It did not take them long to compile a list and write a script to hit all of the Snowflake victims simultaneously." The stolen AT&T data included call and text messaging metadata, but not the content of calls or messages or the names of the phone owners, according to AT&T's SEC filing. The stolen data included telephone numbers of "Nearly all" of AT&T's cellular customers and the numbers of customers of other wireless carriers who exchanged calls or messages with those AT&T customers between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023, according to the company. News of the breach became public on Friday only when AT&T disclosed it in its blog post and SEC filing. Although public companies are required to report breaches to the SEC after learning about them, AT&T wrote that the Department of Justice had granted it exemptions in May and June to delay notification due to a potential national security or public safety harm if the breach were revealed. The FBI told CNN that AT&T had contacted the bureau shortly after learning about the hack, but the bureau wanted to review the data to determine what had been taken and assess any potential harm before AT&T disclosed it publicly and to the SEC. The hacker who received the payment from AT&T alleges that Binns was responsible for the breach and shared samples of the data with him and others after downloading it.
