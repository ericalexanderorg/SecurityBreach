Though the Library is slowly recovering and has admirably published their cyber-incident review paper openly, the incident highlights failures of senior management and devaluing of library technical skills that are widely applicable to libraries across UK higher education. Library systems teams have been drastically reduced, in some cases to a single systems librarian and in other cases outsourcing library systems management to equally overstretched IT departments or to third-party corporate vendors. In lieu of investing in staff with expertise in library systems and core infrastructure, senior managers have instead chased short-term Silicon Valley fads like blockchain, the metaverse, and most recently large-language model 'AI'. The trend to corporate outsourcing in library systems is clear from Marshall Breeding's Library Technology Guides, which shows that the vast majority of UK higher education providers outsource their library systems to corporate vendors. As well as money, libraries also give away valuable data to these corporations in the form of bibliographic records produced through the labour of library staff and the personal data of library users, many of whom don't know that their data and lending records are given away to large corporations. It is therefore interesting to note that the British Library's review paper says that "Email, finance, HR and payroll systems are cloud-based and are functioning normally", but that the library management system is one of a "Large number of legacy systems" that were not only vulnerable to attack, but were extremely difficult to restore to bring core library services back online. Either because of their own lack of specialist librarianship knowledge, or because they were focused on generic managerial achievements, senior management neglected the British Library's core library systems. The reverberations of the 2023 British Library cyber-attack will be felt for a long time, not only by the UK's national library, but by every culture and heritage organisation that can learn from its mistakes.
