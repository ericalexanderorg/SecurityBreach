Researchers at Cybernews.com recently discovered an unsecured Amazon Simple Storage Service containing a huge trove of data from a student loan company. Researchers at Cybernews.com recently discovered an unsecured Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket that contains more than 55,000 call recordings between loan support workers and American consumers with outstanding student loans. The database seems to belong to members of the Student Advocates Group, which an FTC press release named as a student loan debt relief scheme that "Bilked millions out of consumers by charging illegal upfront fees and falsely promising to lower or even eliminate consumers' loan payments or balances." Some loan support agents help consumers set up security questions so that the consumer can verify that the call is coming from the loan company. In one of the calls, the loan support agent provides a customer a phone number connected to the Progress Advocates Group LLC, a company that offers "Student loan consolidation services." PAG is related to the Student Advocates Group debt relief scheme, which the FTC claims stole millions of dollars from American consumers by misleading them about its ability to lower their student loan debt. Based on the FTC complaint, the SAGS scam involved the various LLCs contacting and convincing struggling consumers that SAGS can help them lower or eliminate their student loan debt.
