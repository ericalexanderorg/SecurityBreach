Attackers are now actively targeting over 92,000 end-of-life D-Link Network Attached Storage devices exposed online and unpatched against a critical remote code execution zero-day flaw. Mirai variants are usually designed to add infected devices to a botnet that can be used in large-scale distributed denial-of-service attacks. When asked whether security updates would be released to patch this zero-day vulnerability, D-Link also told BleepingComputer that they no longer supported these end-of-life NAS devices. The spokesperson added that these NAS devices do not have automatic online updating or alert delivery capabilities, making it impossible to notify the owners of these ongoing attacks. "If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the last known firmware," D-Link warned. What D-Link didn't say is that NAS devices shouldn't be exposed online since they are commonly targeted in ransomware attacks to steal or encrypt data. Over 92,000 exposed D-Link NAS devices have a backdoor account.
