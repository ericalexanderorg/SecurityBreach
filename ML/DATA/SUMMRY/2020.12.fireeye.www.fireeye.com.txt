Recently, we were attacked by a highly sophisticated threat actor, one whose discipline, operational security, and techniques lead us to believe it was a state-sponsored attack. We hope that by sharing the details of our investigation, the entire community will be better equipped to fight and defeat cyber attacks. Based on my 25 years in cyber security and responding to incidents, I've concluded we are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities. The attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye. These tools mimic the behavior of many cyber threat actors and enable FireEye to provide essential diagnostic security services to our customers. We are sharing these countermeasures with our colleagues in the security community so that they can update their security tools. We have learned and continue to learn more about our adversaries as a result of this attack, and the greater security community will emerge from this incident better protected.
