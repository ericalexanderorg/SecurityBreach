Hackers have already compromised more than 2,300 Linear eMerge E3 building access systems exploiting a severe vulnerability that has yet to be fixed. LineareMerge E3 smart building access systems designed by Nortek Security & Control are affected by a severe vulnerability that has yet to be fixed and attackers are actively scanning the internet for vulnerable devices. Researchers from SonicWall revealed that hackers are attempting to compromise Linear eMerge E3 smart building access systems to recruit them in a DDoS botnet. Krstic conducted a year-long study on building management, building automation and access control products from Nortek, Prima Systems, Optergy, and Computrols. According to a report recently published by SonicWall, hackers are scanning the Internet for NSC Linear eMerge E3 devices to exploit the CVE-2019-7256 flaw. Threat actors are compromising the access control systems using the CVE-2019-7256 flaw and install a DDoS bot, the malicious activity was first reported on January 9 by Bad Packets. The hackers are actively targeting devices exposed online that are located in over 100 countries, most of them in the U.S. Experts recommend to disconnect the vulnerable NSC LineareMerge E3 devices from the internet or limiting the access to them.
