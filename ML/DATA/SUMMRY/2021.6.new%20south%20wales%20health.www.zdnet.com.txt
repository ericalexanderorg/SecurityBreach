"Following the NSW government's advice earlier this year around a world-wide cyber attack that included NSW government agencies, NSW Health is notifying people whose data may have been accessed in the global Accellion cyber attack," it said in a statement. The state entity said medical records in public hospitals were not affected and the software involved is no longer in use by NSW Health. NSW Health said it has been working with NSW Police and Cyber Security NSW and that to date, there is no evidence any of the information has been misused.

"If you are contacted by NSW Health, you will be given the cyber incident help line details; if you are not contacted by NSW Health, no action is required." The NSW Police Force and Cyber Security NSW have set up Strike Force Martine to determine the impact on NSW government agencies that were caught up in the attack on Accellion.
