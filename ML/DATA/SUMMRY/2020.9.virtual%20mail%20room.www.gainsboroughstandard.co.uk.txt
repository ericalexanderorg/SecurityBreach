London-based outsourcing firm Virtual Mail Room was hit by a targeted attack in June, when more than 50,000 letters sent out by banks and local authorities were indexed by Google - which meant they could appear on public search results. The breach included 2,300 letters sent by councils in Croydon, Eastbourne, Reigate, North Tyneside, Ashford, North East Derbyshire and West Lindsey and o ne database showed the details of hundreds of people receiving letters from housing associations. "A spokesman for the authority said:"West Lindsey District Council has been made aware that one of our suppliers has been a victim of cybercrime and has confirmed a security breach. "However, the breach does not constitute a 'high' risk to the individuals affected." "West Lindsey District Council takes all incidents seriously and as a result we have reported to the Information Commissioners Office and an investigation is currently underway." Virtual Mail Room's clients include Metro Bank, publisher Pearson and insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor. Wired said the breach raised doubts over due diligence and could be in breach of data protection laws.
