A Portland-area school district has canceled Tuesday and Wednesday classes as staffers work to fix a ransomware attack that may have affected the district's technology systems. Centennial School District staff discovered Monday that certain digital files had been "Encrypted by an unknown actor," the district said in a statement. The district took its technology systems offline as a precaution so hackers could not access any more information. The district also reported the breach to federal investigators, hired a cybersecurity firm and launched its own investigation into how the system could have been hacked. Ransomware attacks on school systems have increased recently, according to the Associated Press. There have already been at least 21 ransomware attacks in the U.S. education sector this year, Brett Callow, a threat analyst for the anti-malware company Emsisoft, told the Associated Press on April 21.The attacks have disrupted 550 schools, Callow said. The Centennial School District serves more than 6,100 students in the Southeast Portland and Gresham area.
