On Sunday 22 November 2020 - 59 Aged Care Royal Commission documents were impacted in a cyber security incident. The Royal Commission files were stored and secured by a reputable document management service provider - demonstrating that even cyber security experts are unable to completely remove the risk. An IBM report - The Rising Cost of a Data Breach in 2020 - estimated the average cost of a data breach in Australia to be $3.35 million. For the Royal Commission's document management service provider, the November incident resulted in shutting down key systems, completing a forensic examination, implementing a range of security enhancements to its systems and networks and having to work with both the Australian Federal Police and the Australia Cyber Security Centre. In line with the ACSC's advice, the Aged Care Industry Information Technology Council also recommended the need for higher levels of technology governance across the aged care sector. This recommendation stemmed from their 2020 Aged and Community Care Innovation and Technology Capabilities and Readiness report which highlighted many gaps in providers security preparedness. As aged care providers continue to digitise their business, their attractiveness to cyber attackers will continue to rise.
