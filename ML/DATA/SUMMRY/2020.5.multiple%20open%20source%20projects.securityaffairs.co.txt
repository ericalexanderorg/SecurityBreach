GitHub has issued a security alert warning of a piece of malware dubbed Octopus Scanner that is spreading on its platform via boobytrapped NetBeans Java projects. "GitHub's Security Incident Response Team received its initial notification about a set of repositories serving malware-infected open source projects from security researcher JJ." reads a post published by Github. The Octopus Scanner identifies the NetBeans project files and embeds malicious payload both in project files and build JAR files. Experts uncovered 26 open source projects that were backdoored by the Octopus Scanner malware and that were serving backdoored code. The malware scans the victim's workstation for a local NetBeans IDE install, and attempt to backdoor other developer's Java projects. "If malware developers took the time to implement this malware specifically for NetBeans, it means that it could either be a targeted attack, or they may already have implemented the malware for build systems such as Make, MsBuild, Gradle and others as well and it may be spreading unnoticed,".
