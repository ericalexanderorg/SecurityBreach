In 2010 US-based HBGary investigated an information security incident related to the Winnti group at one of HBGary's customers - an American video game company. Interestingly, the digital signature belonged to another video game vendor - a private company known as KOG, based in South Korea. At the same time, in March 2013, Uyghur activists were targeted by other malware, which was digitally signed by another gaming company called MGAME Corp. We believe that the source of all these stolen certificates could be the same Winnti group. During our investigation of an infection at a computer game company, we found that malware had been created for a particular service on the company's server. Any changes the Winnti team introduces into the game experience are unlikely to be very noticeable. Maintaining a skillful balance is the main attribute of online games! Users will simply stop playing if they feel that other players are using non-standard methods to create an advantage beyond normal gameplay or if the game loses its intrinsic competitiveness due to resources or artifacts appearing in the game without the developers' knowledge. At the same time the attackers are keen for the game to remain popular; otherwise, they would be unable to effectively turn all the time and effort of infecting a gaming company into financial gain.
