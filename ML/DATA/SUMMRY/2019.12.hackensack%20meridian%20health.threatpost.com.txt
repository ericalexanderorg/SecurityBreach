New Jersey's largest hospital system said that it has paid hackers a ransom after a ransomware attack disrupted its services earlier this month. The hospital system told media outlets on Friday that it was targeted by a cyberattack on Dec. 2, crippling its computer software systems for nearly five days. The attack affected the hospital's computer software systems, from scheduling and billing systems to labs and radiology, according to reports. The ransomware attack forced the hospitals that were part of Hackensack Meridian Health system to reschedule around 100 non-emergency appointments and surgeries earlier in December. The hospital system did not clarify how much ransom it paid, or whether its data has since been recovered. "You would assume that the industry would have implemented an incident response plan and a solid backup/recovery process by now. However, we still see struggles once a system is infected as it spreads through the network, forcing IT to revert to pen and paper. We have to accept that people are going to click on stuff so we need to raise the priority of implementing the principle of least privilege, which will reduce the possibility of ransomware infecting systems and spreading throughout the network." That's a move that security professionals have long condemned, warning that paying the ransom in a ransomware attack could end up causing more turmoil for victims - as well as inspire other cybercriminals to launch ransomware attacks.
