The hackers retrieved some material from Microsoft, but by March 22nd Microsoft announced it had quickly stopped the hacking attempt and only one account was compromised. In January 2022, hackers carried out an attack on servers hosting the personal information of more than 500,000 people receiving services from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The hacked servers contained data related to the organization's Restoring Family Links services, which works to reconnect people separated by war, migration, and violence. Confidential data including ID information, drivers' licenses, and passwords was stolen and then offered for sale on popular hacking message boards. A hacking group called Uawrongteam managed to compromise FlexBooker's data by exploiting its AWS configuration. Luckily, no account credentials were stolen in the attack, and the hacker only stole a limited amount of identifiable information. Experts say the attack looks like it came from the hacker group BlackHat gang - a Russian group that has attacked oil pipelines in the past.
