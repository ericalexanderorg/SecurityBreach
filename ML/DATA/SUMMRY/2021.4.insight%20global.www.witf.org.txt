A vendor working with the Pennsylvania Department of Health exposed the private information of more than 72,000 people, including sensitive details such as sexual orientation and whether the person was exposed to COVID-19. Since 2020, Insight Global has provided COVID-19 contract tracing services for the Pennsylvania Health Department. Some of the online documents included phone numbers, email addresses and personal information such as gender, age, sexual orientation, COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure status, Ciccocioppo said. The lawmaker said he first became aware of the problem more than three weeks ago when a reporter met with him and showed him a laptop with what looked like a Google spreadsheet listing thousands of names and corresponding information. "Why wasn't the administration doing more to make sure the vendors were following the rules of the contract, to make sure peoples' information was safe and secure?". "In the throes of a global pandemic, they trusted this administration to do the right thing with their personal, identifiable information in an effort to keep people safe," Benninghoff said. According to WPXI-TV, which broke the story, former workers at Insight Global said they told supervisors, but nothing was done to protect the information.
