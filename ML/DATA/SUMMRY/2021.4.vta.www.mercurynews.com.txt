As she got ready to go to work last Monday morning, 40-year-old Amanda Evans expected to see the Valley Transportation Authority paratransit bus she uses for her daily commute pull up outside her Santa Clara home around 8 a.m. The bus never showed. Unbeknownst to Evans, VTA had been struck by a cyberattack over the weekend that had forced the shutdown of many of the transit agency's core computer systems - including the one that tracks reservations for paratransit service. Nobody at VTA bothered to let her know her ride to work wasn't going to be arriving as scheduled Monday morning, Evans said, and by the time she finally got through to the agency's reservation line last Monday she was told nobody was available to come pick her up. VTA spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said the authority sent notifications about the computer problems to "Critical appointment clients," such as those who had appointments for rides to dialysis treatment, and put a recorded message about it on a customer service line. With digital systems unavailable and workers scrambling to schedule the hundreds of paratransit trips VTA provides each day Hendler Ross said broader outreach to roughly 7,000 clients in its database wasn't feasible. Christine Fitzgerald, a community advocate with the Silicon Valley Independent Living Center and a member of VTA's transportation accessibility committee, said she has also heard from riders with disabilities who have reported problems making or confirming their trip reservations with the phone system since the cyberattack began. Evans said VTA workers have told her she can only schedule trips one day in advance, meaning she would need to call every day to arrange the commute rides that were previously scheduled automatically.
