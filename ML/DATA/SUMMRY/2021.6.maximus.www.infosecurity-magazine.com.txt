A security incident at an Ohio Medicaid provider last month may have resulted in the theft of personal data. On Monday, the Ohio Department of Medicaid warned that an unknown party had accessed data in the care of Maximus for two days in May without authorization. Maximus said the breached data could have been stolen. Data concerning Medicaid patients or beneficiaries was not affected by the security incident, which occurred from May 17 to May 19, when it was detected by Maximus. An investigation into the data breach was launched and is being monitored by the Medicaid department. In May 2018, Maximus notified thousands of patients of a data breach caused by a printing error. The error impacted letters prepared and mailed by the data company's print vendor, Business Ink, between February 10 and February 13, 2018.
