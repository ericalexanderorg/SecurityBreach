We are writing to notify you about an issue that may involve your MyFitnessPal account information. On March 25, 2018, we became aware that during February of this year an unauthorized party acquired data associated with MyFitnessPal user accounts. The affected information included usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords - the majority with the hashing function called bcrypt used to secure passwords. We are working with leading data security firms to assist in our investigation. We are notifying MyFitnessPal users to provide information on how they can protect their data. We will be requiring MyFitnessPal users to change their passwords and urge users to do so immediately. Change your password for any other account on which you used the same or similar information used for your MyFitnessPal account.
