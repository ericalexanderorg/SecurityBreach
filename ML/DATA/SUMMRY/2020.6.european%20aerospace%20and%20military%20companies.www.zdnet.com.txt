Speaking in a live stream to an audience of thousands, ESET security researcher Jean-Ian Boutin said the attacks have been carried out by members of the Lazarus Group - codename given by security firms to North Korea's biggest hacking unit, part of the country's intelligence service. On the infected employee's computer, the hackers would continue to operate using their initial foothold and expand their access inside the hacked company's network. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't surprising as North Korean hackers have repeatedly engaged in cyber-heists for the past three years, targeting both banks and cryptocurrency exchanges. In September 2019, the US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on entities associated with North Korea's hacking units, claiming the country was using its hacker groups to steal money and raise funds for Pyongyang's weapons and missile programs. The use of LinkedIn for approaching targets has been an old tactic employed by North Korean hackers. In January 2019, the same Lazarus hackers used LinkedIn messages to contact employees working in the banking sector and arrange job interviews via Skype, where victims were given malware-laced files. This is how security researchers believe North Korean hackers breached Redbanc, the company that interconnects the ATM infrastructure of all Chilean banks.
