Sophos received a report on April 22, 2020, at 20:29 UTC regarding an XG Firewall with a suspicious field value visible in the management interface. Sophos commenced an investigation and the incident was determined to be an attack against physical and virtual XG Firewall units. The attack used a previously unknown SQL injection vulnerability to gain access to exposed XG devices. This hotfix eliminated the SQL injection vulnerability which prevented further exploitation, stopped the XG Firewall from accessing any attacker infrastructure, and cleaned up any remnants from the attack. The XG Firewall hotfix that Sophos deployed includes a message on the XG management interface to indicate whether or not a given XG Firewall was affected by this attack. The vulnerability affected all versions of XG Firewall firmware on both physical and virtual firewalls. All supported versions of the XG Firewall firmware / SFOS received the hotfix.
