A Web3 developer shared the unfortunate story of losing funds after accidentally making his wallet keys publicly available on the developer platform GitHub. On June 5, Brian Guan, co-founder of the Web3 streaming app Unlonely, shared a post on X, claiming that he lost $40,000 after making a repository on GitHub public. The developer said he forgot that his secret keys were in the repository. Crypto community sentiment split When Guan's post went viral on X, the reactions from the crypto community were mixed. Some members expressed sympathy for the developer and offered support, while others unearthed Guan's past comments about developers using OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, to write code. According to Guan, projects that pay smart contract engineers $200,000 are "Ngmi," which is short for "Not gonna make it." The Web3 founder said that any solid developer "Should be able to write solidity with the help of ChatGPT.". Because of this, community member Foobar posted a parody of Guan's previous post, saying that if somebody is paying $200 for a hardware wallet, they're not gonna make it and that developers should be able to store private keys in their GitHub with the help of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, another user said that while they were sorry for what happened, Guan's opinions on developers reeked of "Gen Z entitlement."
