"As a result of the attack, personal information for those who registered for TRB annual meetings from 2015-2021, may have been exposed and obtained in the attack," TRB said in an email to all conference registrants since 2015. The vendor, J. Spargo & Associates Inc., based in Fairfax, Va., alerted TRB to the hack on March 14, TRB said. "As a result of the attack, if you registered for the TRB Annual Meeting from 2015-2021, registration information that was held in the vendor's system may have been exposed and obtained by the cybercriminals." "A small group of TRB annual participants provided driver's license information or student identification information to the vendor, which may have also been accessed by the cybercriminals." TRB is part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, providing leadership in transportation improvements and innovation through "Trusted, timely, impartial and evidence-based information exchange, research and advice regarding all modes of transportation," according to its webpage. The vendor said it is working with federal authorities to investigate the matter and that it would keep TRB informed as the investigation unfolds, TRB said. "Although we do not yet know all the details of this breach, in the spirit of transparency, TRB wanted to share what we do know at this time and what we are doing to address it," Neil Pedersen, TRB's executive director, said in a statement to Transport Topics.
