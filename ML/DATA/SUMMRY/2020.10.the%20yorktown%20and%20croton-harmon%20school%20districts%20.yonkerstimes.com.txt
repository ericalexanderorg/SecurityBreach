The Yorktown and Croton-Harmon school districts in Westchester County recently had their computer systems hacked by a cyber security attack coming from someone seekiing to get a payment to remove the ransomware that froze both systems. The Yorktown schools were forced to temporarily shifted from a hybrid learning model to all-remote lessons after its district shared news of a cyberattack on Oct. 12. The ransomware attack encrypted data on the Yorktown Central School District's networks, forcing officials to restore servers from backups and go room-to-room to reimage devices, Superintendent Ron Hattar said in an email to parents Thursday viewed by WSJ Pro Cybersecurity. Two Westchester school districts were targeted by a cyber security attack on school-based desktops and laptops that kept students learning at home. The Croton-Harmon school district also faced a similar attached this month. Yorktown Superintendent Ron Hattar did not specify the kind of cyber attack his district faced in communications to the community, but said the district's response was difficult. Ransomware attacks are an increasingly common kind of cybersecurity breach facing school districts.
