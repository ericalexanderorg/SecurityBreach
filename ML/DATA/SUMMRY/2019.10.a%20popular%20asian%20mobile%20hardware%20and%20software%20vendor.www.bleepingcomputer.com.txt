Winnti Group hackers have updated their arsenal with a new modular Windows backdoor that they used to infect the servers of a high-profile Asian mobile hardware and software manufacturer. The hacking group's ShadowPad malware also received some updates, with random module IDs and some extra obfuscation being the most noteworthy additions according to ESET researchers who monitored the hackers' attacks throughout the year. A supply chain attack against a video game developer was found to be behind this large scale attack, which led to the malware being distributed via a game's official update server. ESET researchers who spotted the new malware dubbed PortReuse by Winnti Group also discovered that it is "a network implant that injects itself into a process that is already listening on a network port and waits for an incoming magic packet to trigger the malicious code." PortReuse also has no need for command and control servers as it uses the NetAgent listener it injects in legitimate processes to wait for attackers to connect to the compromised servers. ESET researchers were also able to find several PortReuse ??????variants, each of them targeting different services and ports, including DNS over TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, Remote Desktop Protocol and Windows Remote Management. More details on the new and updated Winnti Group malware is available in ESET's blog post and their Winnti Group white paper.
