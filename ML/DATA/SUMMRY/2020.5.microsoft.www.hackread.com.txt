Now, in the latest, we have discovered that a hacker going by the online handle of Shiny Hunters is claiming to have hacked Microsoft's own GitHub account allegedly allowing the hacker to the company's private repositories. See: GoDaddy suffers data breach after hackers access SSH accounts. Coming to the type of data exposed, it has been reported that the attacker even posted 1 GB of the data on one hacker forum allowing users to access it through the site's built-in credits. This data was found to be featuring Chinese text and other such similar references in a few files which made many believe that the data was not from Microsoft as claimed. Data breach monitoring firm Under the Breach also expressed their views on Twitter about the nature of the data exposed saying that it was highly likely that it was real. While for some companies Github serves as a tool to store valuable source code in the form of private repositories, companies as large as Microsoft aren't likely to do the same as they are self-sufficient and have secured internal systems designed to hold sensitive source codes, Under the Breach told HackRead.com. Under The Breach contacted Microsoft to make sure they're aware of the leak and will replace any keys or passwords exposed if there are any, the company explained.
