Wll DLL proceeds to download and decrypt the next stage of the infection chain, from one of the threat actor's servers: 95.179.242[.]6. The next stage downloaded is also a DLL file, and it serves as the main loader of the malware framework developed by the attackers. At the final stage of the infection chain, after the appropriate command is received, the malicious loader downloads and decrypts a RAT module, also in the form of a DLL file, and loads it into memory. Dll 207477076d069999533e0150be06a20ba74d5378 http dll. Dll b942e1d1a0b5f0e66da3aa9bbd0fb46b8e16d71d http dll. Dll 9ef97f90dcdfe123ccb7d9b45e6fa9eceb2446f0 hcc dll. To recap, the second stage payload in the attack chain, is an encrypted DLL file named minisdllpub. Dll then decodes the given payload and dynamically loads the new PE to memory.
