The cyber threat actor connected multiple times by Transmission Control Protocol from IP address 185.86.151[.]223 to the victim organization's virtual private network server. It is possible the cyber actor obtained the credentials from an unpatched agency VPN server by exploiting a known vulnerability-CVE-2019-11510-in Pulse Secure. The actor logged into the same email account via Remote Desktop Protocol from IP address 207.220.1[.]3. The actor enumerated the Active Directory and Group Policy key and changed a registry key for the Group Policy. The cyber threat actor then attempted multiple times to connect to virtual private server IP 185.86.151[.]223 through a Windows Server Message Block client. CISA analysts detected the cyber threat actor interacting with other files on users' home directories but could not confirm whether they were exfiltrated. Create two compressed Zip files with several files and directories on them; it is likely that the cyber threat actor exfiltrated these Zip files, but this cannot be confirmed because the actor masked their activity. CISA analysts determined that the cyber threat actor accessed the anti-malware product's software license key and installation guide and then visited a directory used by the product for temporary file analysis.
