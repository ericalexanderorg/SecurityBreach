IoT solutions provider Sierra Wireless has been forced to halt production at its manufacturing site after being hit by a ransomware attack. The attack took place on 20 March, and was discovered by the company three days later. Sierra Wireless announced that it has "Implemented measures to counter the attack in accordance with established cyber security procedures and policies that were developed in collaboration with third-party advisors". Although Sierra Wireless' customer-facing products and services are thought to have come out fo the attack unscathed, the company has asked its customers and partners for patience "As it seeks to remediate the situation". The ransomware attack has also forced the company to halt production at its manufacturing sites but is hoping to resume normal operations "Soon". The incident comes just days after ransomware collective REvil demanded $50 million from Acer, in what is thought to be the gang's most costly attack yet. The Acer ransomware attack is believed to be linked to the Microsoft Exchange hack from earlier this month, which was orchestrated by 'at least ten hacker groups' and affected 'hundreds of thousands' of victims, including in the UK.Featured Resources.
