A total count of unique people across all data sets reached more than 1.2 billion people, making this one of the largest data leaks from a single source organization in history. What makes this data leak unique is that it contains data sets that appear to originate from 2 different data enrichment companies. The majority of the data spanned 4 separate data indexes, labeled "PDL" and "OXY", with information on roughly 1 billion people per index. Based on our analysis of the data, we believe the data in the PDL indexes originated from People Data Labs, a data aggregator and enrichment company. The data discovered on the open Elasticsearch server was almost a complete match to the data being returned by the People Data Labs API. The only difference being the data returned by the PDL also contained education histories. The data they sent contained mostly scraped LinkedIN profile, and appears to be a match for the data data. The lion's share of the data is marked as "PDL", indicating that it originated from People Data Labs.
