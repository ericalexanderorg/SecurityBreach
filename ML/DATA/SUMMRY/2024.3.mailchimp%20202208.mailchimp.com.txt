At Mailchimp, the security of our users' data is our top priority. On August 8, our Security team became aware of an unauthorized actor accessing one of our tools used by customer-facing teams for customer support and account administration. Across the tech industry, malicious actors are increasingly deploying an array of sophisticated phishing and social engineering tactics targeting data and information from crypto-related companies. In response to a recent attack targeting Mailchimp's crypto-related users, we've taken proactive measures to temporarily suspend account access for accounts where we detected suspicious activity while we investigate the incident further. We did not suspend accounts based on their industry, and we are committed to continuing to serve crypto companies. On August 22, we followed up with an email to the account owner for all affected accounts with steps to help users reinstate access to their Mailchimp accounts safely. Based on our investigation to date, it appears that 214 Mailchimp accounts were affected by the incident.
