Hackers are attempting to sell what they say is confidential information belonging to millions of Santander staff and customers. The bank - which employs 200,000 people worldwide, including around 20,000 in the UK - has confirmed data has been stolen. Santander has apologised for what it says is "The concern this will understandably cause" adding it is "Proactively contacting affected customers and employees directly." "Following an investigation, we have now confirmed that certain information relating to customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay, as well as all current and some former Santander employees of the group had been accessed," it said in a statement posted earlier this month. In a post on a hacking forum - first spotted by researchers at Dark Web Informer- the group calling themselves ShinyHunters posted an advert saying they had data including. Santander has not commented on the accuracy of those claims. ShinyHunters have previously sold data confirmed to have been stolen from US telecoms firm AT&T. The gang is also selling what it says is a huge amount of private data from Ticketmaster.
