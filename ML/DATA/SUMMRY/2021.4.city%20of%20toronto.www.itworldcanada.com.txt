The City of Toronto says it suffered a "Potential cyber breach" from a hack of data from use of its Accellion FTA file transfer server in January that may have involved the health information of individuals. In its initial statement today, the city said it was notified of a potential cyber breach related to an unnamed third-party file transfer software vendor on Jan. 22. City staff later confirmed to IT World Canada that the incident involved Accellion. In its statement, the city said it "Took immediate action and shut down access to the software that day, and the city's chief information security officer immediately launched an investigation to determine the type of data that may have been compromised." The city has reported the breach to the provincial Information and Privacy Commissioner and will communicate with any individuals whose information may have been breached. "The City of Toronto successfully wards off cyber attacks on a daily basis and is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Torontonians whose information is in its care and control," says the April 30 news release from the city. In February, cybersecurity agencies across five countries issued a global alert to organizations using the Accellion FTA file transfer application after a number of organizations at the start of the year admitted to being hacked through vulnerabilities in the software.
