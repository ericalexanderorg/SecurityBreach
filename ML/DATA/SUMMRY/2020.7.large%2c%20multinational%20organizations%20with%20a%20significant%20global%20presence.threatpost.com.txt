The BEC gang is called Cosmic Lynx, and has been associated with more than 200 BEC campaigns targeting senior-level executives in 46 countries since last July. While many BEC groups are relatively target-agnostic, Cosmic Lynx has a well-defined victim profile, researchers say. "Unlike most BEC emails that are riddled with misspelled words and grammatical errors, Cosmic Lynx emails are usually very detailed and written in nearly perfect English," researchers said. While the average amount requested in most executive impersonation BEC attacks is $55,000, researchers said Cosmic Lynx emails have asked for hundreds of thousands, and sometimes even millions, of dollars. Another clue is that some of the infrastructure used by Cosmic Lynx to send BEC emails overlaps with infrastructure used by Trickbot and Emotet malware, which they said is believed to be tied to Russian actors. Cosmic Lynx represents new breed of more sophisticated, harder-to-detect BEC attacks, researchers warn. "Unlike traditional BEC groups, Cosmic Lynx has demonstrated the capability to develop much more complex and creative attacks that sets them apart from other more generic BEC attacks we see everyday," they said.
