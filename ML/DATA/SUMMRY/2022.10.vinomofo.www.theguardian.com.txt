Wine dealer Vinomofo is the latest Australian company to be targeted by a cyber-attack. At risk of exposure are the names, dates of birth, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and genders of customers - Vinomofo has about 500,000 people on its books, but it's not clear if all were exposed. Vinomofo said the risk to members was "Low" because other information, such as passports, credit card details and driver's licences were not held by Vinomofo. "Vinomofo experienced a cybersecurity incident where an unauthorised third party unlawfully accessed our database on a testing platform that is not linked to our live Vinomofo website," the chief executive, Paul Edginton, said in a statement emailed to customers. "Vinomofo does not hold identity or financial data such as passports, driver's licences or credit cards/bank details. While no passwords, identity documents or financial information were accessed, the database includes other information about customers and members." Weeks after the initial attack, Optus revealed that customers whose passport numbers were exposed would no longer be able to use them to access identity verification services online, making it harder to access government agencies and financial institutions. MyDeal, an online retail store owned by Woolworths, has also had a recent data breach, with 2.2 million customers' details exposed.
