A BuzzFeed News investigation reveals how injected links are sold by global networks of online marketplaces and black hat SEO consultants who offer customers the ability to have links placed on compromised websites. It's yet another example of how search engines like Google are being manipulated at scale by a global industry of shady digital marketers and hackers who take over expired domains, acquire once-credible websites and fill them with junk content, hijack dead links on major news sites, place undisclosed sponsored content, and launch extensive manipulation campaigns using fake online personas to make their content appear higher in search results. "Sape is continuously vigilant and expends a considerable amount of effort and expense on monitoring and addressing the problem of injected links and constantly working on improving anti-hacking algorithms. Each time a hack is identified, Sape has no choice but to immediately assign a team to remedy the situation, providing support to hacked websites and refunding significant amounts to customers, who purchased links on sites, which turn out to be compromised by hackers," he said. On its website, the company boasts it can secure links on thousands of websites and that "The sites in our inventory are ethically obtained using our decade long experience in outreach and guest posting." After being sent a list of sites with injected links pointing to his company's site, Zyabkin blamed it on employees buying links through online marketplaces. Another SEO company that has benefitted from injected links is DFY Links. In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Floate was adamant he'd never hacked into websites to add links, nor ever knowingly bought or sold hacked links.
