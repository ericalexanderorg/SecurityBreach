A state program that was created to process unemployment applications in Arkansas for self-employed individuals or gig economy workers appears to have been illegally accessed and has been shut down, officials announced Saturday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he learned Friday evening that an applicant for the program is believed to have somehow accessed the system, prompting an investigation of a possible data breach. News of the program breach was first reported on Friday by the Arkansas Times. About 30,000 people have applied to the program, which has had other problems. At least 4,578 people in Arkansas have tested positive for the coronavirus, Dr. Nate Smith, Arkansas' health secretary, said Saturday. The true number is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Ninety-eight people in the state have died from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
