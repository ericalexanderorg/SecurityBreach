The Singapore telco detected a data dump on a third-party site containing personal information of more than 57,000 of its customers. StarHub said that the data is at least 14 years old, as the information was of customers who subscribed to StarHub before 2007, and it is not aware of any malicious misuse of the data so far. Another action StarHub took after discovering the file was to "Attempt to have the document removed from the data dump site" but it did not explicitly say if the attempt had been successful. StarHub is reaching out to those customers whose data has been compromised via email and the communication to all affected customers is expected to be completed within the next two weeks. StarHub is only the latest telco to suffer customer data breach. StarHub emphasised that "No StarHub information systems or customer database are compromised", which is probably the least bad part of the whole incident. This could also be a subtle dig at Singtel, StarHub's competitor, which suffered a data breach early this year when personal data including names, addresses, phone numbers, identification numbers, and dates of birth of 129,000 of its customers were hacked.
