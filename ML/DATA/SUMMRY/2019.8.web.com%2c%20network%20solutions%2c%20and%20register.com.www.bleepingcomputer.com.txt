World's first domain registrar Network Solutions disclosed a security breach that happened in late August 2019, and allowed a third-party to infiltrate some of the company's computing systems without authorization and potentially access some customers' personally identifiable information. Network Solutions entered into a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation for services including the domain name registration services on December 31, 1992. "On October 16, 2019, Network Solutions determined that a third-party gained unauthorized access to a limited number of our computer systems in late August 2019, and as a result, account information may have been accessed," says the breach notice. Network Solutions hired an independent cybersecurity firm to investigate the incident immediately after discovering the security breach. "Safeguarding our customer's information is core to our mission. We are committed to protecting our customers against misuse of their information and have invested heavily in cybersecurity," Network Solutions says. This is not the first time Network Solutions was impacted by a security breach. BleepingComputer asked Network Solutions to specify the number of customers impacted in the security breach since this information was not disclosed but did not hear back at the time of publication.
