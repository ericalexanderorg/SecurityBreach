Going by the online alias Gnosticplayers, the serial hacker told The Hacker News that this time, he managed to breach "Words With Friends," a popular Zynga-developed word puzzle game, and unauthorisedly access a massive database of more than 218 million users. In a statement published over a week ago, Zynga admitted the data breach, revealing that the "Account login information for certain players of Draw Something and Words With Friends that may have been accessed," though the company did not reveal the number of affected users. Based on a sample data Gnosticplayers shared with The Hacker News, the stolen users' information includes their:Names. "As a precaution, we have taken steps to protect these users' accounts from invalid logins. We plan to notify players as the investigation proceeds further." What's your take? If you are a user of the Words With Friends game, you should immediately change the password for your account and also on other services in the event you re-used the same password. The Hacker News has already reached out to Zynga for a comment and will update this story if we hear back. In March 2019, the same hacker compromised over 26 million online accounts originating from 6 websites and put the stolen records for sale on the popular dark-web market called Dream Market. In February, the hacker made three rounds of stolen accounts up for sale on Dream Market, posting details of 620 million online accounts stolen from 16 websites in the first round, 127 million from 8 sites in the second, and 92 million from 8 websites in the third.
