UnitingCare Queensland has fallen victim to a ransomware attack that has taken some of the organisation's digital and technology systems offline. The attack represents the latest example of cyber attackers targeting the aged-care and healthcare sectors with ransomware. The ACSC has recommended that providers targeted with ransomware never pay a demand, as there is no guarantee that paying the victim will result in encrypted data being unlocked, and because this could make organisations vulnerable to further attacks. "Once illegal access has been obtained into an aged-care facility there is also information available for employees, vendors, general business information which provides even more reason for cybercriminals to target this sector." VMWare Principal Cybersecurity Strategist Rick McElroy said the attack has highlighted the vulnerability of Australia's healthcare sector to cyber attacks. "Ransomware as a service has risen in popularity providing cybercriminals with the necessary tools to carry out these types of attacks - this has created the opportunity for millions to easily target healthcare organisations. Compounding these risks is the adage of affiliate programs for ransomware groups, providing new and unique ways for malware operators to have others deploy their payloads for a cut of the eventual profits," he said. "We're also seeing a lot of secondary extortion, in which cybercriminals look to profit twice from an attack, forcing organisations to not only pay to decrypt data but also prevent sensitive data from being sold or released publicly," McElroy said.
