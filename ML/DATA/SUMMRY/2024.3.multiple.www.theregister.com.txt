A ransomware infection at a cloud IT provider has disrupted services for 60 or so credit unions across the US, all of which were relying on the attacked vendor. This is according to the National Credit Union Administration, which on Friday told The Register it is fire-fighting the situation with the credit unions downed this week by the intrusion. "I can confirm that approximately 60 credit unions are currently experiencing some level of outage due to a ransomware attack at a third-party service provider," the NCUA spokesperson said. "Member deposits at affected federally insured credit unions are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund up to $250,000." On Thursday, northern New York's Mountain Valley Federal Credit Union appeared to be one of the many orgs suffering "System downtime" as a result of a ransomware infection at Ongoing Operations. "It has been brought to our attention by our data processor - FedComp Inc, that the third-party vendor of our computer operating system 'Trellance' was the victim of a ransomware attack," boss Maggie Pope said [PDF] in a letter to her credit union members. Mountain Valley's Pope continued in her note to customers: "Trellance has indicated that our member information has not been affected by this incident. Because of this, Trellance must move to a new server system. Trellance and FedComp have been working around the clock to get our systems along with other credit unions around the country that have experienced the same issue back online."
