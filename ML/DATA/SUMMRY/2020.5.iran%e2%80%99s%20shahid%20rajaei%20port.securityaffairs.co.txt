Israel is likely behind the recent cyberattack which disrupted some operations at Iran's Shahid Rajaei Port, located near the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian officials did not reveal details of the cyber attack that took place on May 9, two days before Iranian officials disclosed the incident. Now a foreign government security official said the attack was "Highly accurate" and the damages caused to the Iranian infrastructure were greater than described in official Iranian accounts. The news was reported by The Washington Post, which blamed Israel for the cyber attack that was launched in retaliation for an earlier cyberattack on rural water distribution systems in Israel. Earlier May, Israel's security cabinet discussed alleged Iranian cyberattack on Israeli water and sewage facilities that fortunately did not cause serious damage. "Citing unnamed U.S. and foreign government officials, the Post said the May 9 disruption of Iranian computers was presumably in retaliation for an earlier attempted cyberattack on rural water distribution systems in Israel." The news was reported by both the ISNA and Mehr news agencies, the Iranian minister defined the attacks as "Really massive" and attributed them to a nation-state actor.
