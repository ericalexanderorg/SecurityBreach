Airbnb worldwide data breach allowing users to access other users inboxes. Airbnb hosts are reporting a series of worrying privacy breaches happening within the app - allowing them to see the private inboxes of other users. A major data leak currently underway at Airbnb is causing large numbers of hosts to receive access to the wrong inbox. As a result, those hosts are able to see the sensitive information of other users including names, addresses, and the codes to get into people's Airbnb rental homes. Early reports appear to indicate that Airbnb is telling hosts to clear their cookies in order to fix the problem. In fact some hosts are reporting having access to a different inbox each time they log back in, meaning that Airbnb's customer support advice is actually compounding the issue. It will now be necessary to launch a full investigation into the leak to ascertain how and why it occurred, and to figure out what culpability Airbnb should face for having caused such and dangerous data leak.
