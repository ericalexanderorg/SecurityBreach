Dozens of unsecured databases exposed online web wiped by threat actors as part of a campaign tracked as Meow attack. Experts observed dozens of unsecured Elasticsearch and MongoDB instances exposed online that were inexplicably wiped by threat actors as part of a campaign tracked as Meow attack. The Meow attack began recently and attackers did not leave any ransom note or disclaimer after the hack of the install. Immediately after the first attacks, security experts started searching for vulnerable databases exposed online. One of the recent Meow attacks targeted the Hong Kong-based VPN provider UFO VPN, hackers targeted its Elasticsearch database. Security researcher Bob Diachenko reported that the database was first secured in July, but unfortunately, it was exposed a few days later when it was hit by a Meow attack. To avoid being victims of the meow attack, administrators should secure their system and avoid exposing them as result of misconfigurations.
