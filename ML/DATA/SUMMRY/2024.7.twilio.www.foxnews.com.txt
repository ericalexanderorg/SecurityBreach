A hacker claimed to have stolen 33 million phone numbers from U.S. messaging giant Twilio. Twilio has since patched its app to avoid future security incidents and has also cautioned users. On July 3, the hacker group known as ShinyHunters reportedly took to a hacking forum to boast about stealing 33 million cellphone numbers. "We have seen no evidence that the threat actors obtained access to Twilio's systems or other sensitive data. As a precaution, we are requesting all Authy users to update to the latest Android and iOS apps for the latest security updates and encourage all Authy users to stay diligent and have heightened awareness around phishing and smishing attacks." If you've been affected by the Twilio security incident, the first thing you need to do is download the latest version of the Authy app. Roid users can update the app from the Play Store, and iPhone users can head to the App Store. Authy is a two-factor authentication service that users trust, but a security lapse in its system reminds users that no service is foolproof.
