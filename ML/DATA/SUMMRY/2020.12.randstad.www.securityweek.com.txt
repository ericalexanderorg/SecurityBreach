Human resources giant Randstad last week revealed that its IT systems were targeted in a recent cyberattack involving a relatively new piece of ransomware named Egregor. Netherlands-based Randstad is one of the world's largest HR services providers, with more than 38,000 employees and operations in nearly 40 countries. The cybercriminals behind the Egregor ransomware are known to steal data in addition to using the malware to encrypt the victim's files, in an effort to increase their chances of getting paid. "To date, our investigation has revealed that the Egregor group obtained unauthorized and unlawful access to our global IT environment and to certain data, in particular related to our operations in the US, Poland, Italy and France," Randstad said in its statement. The operators of the Egregor ransomware recently also targeted TransLink, the transportation agency of Metro Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. TransLink has reportedly decided not to pay the ransom, but there is no mention of the company on the Egregor website so far. Digital Shadows, a provider of digital risk protection solutions, whose researchers have been monitoring Egregor ransomware attacks, told SecurityWeek that the cybercriminals named 176 victims on their website between September 25 and December 2.
