Cosmetic brands has been informed that a significant data breach was discovered on its web server, which was found to be publicly exposed, without password protection or encryption. The vulnerability effectively means that anyone possessing the server's IP-address could access the company's open database. A few days later, Avon submitted a second regulatory filing declaring that no financial data was involved "As its main e-commerce website does not store that information". Avon.com's server contained API logs for the company's web and mobile sites which meant the data breach exposed all production server information including internal "OAuth tokens". Hackers could potentially harness the server to mine cryptocurrency, plant malware or conduct ransomware attacks upon the server owners. Worryingly, the leak exposed reams of technical logs which could be used to not only target Avon customers but also Avon's IT infrastructure directly, thereby leading to further security risks and financial ramifications. How can you prevent your personal information from being exposed in a data leak and ensure that you are not a victim of attacks - cyber or real-world - if it is leaked?
