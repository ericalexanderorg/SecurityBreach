Personal data of over 7 lakh users has allegedly been leaked on the dark web, where it's available for sale for $350. According to independent cybersecurity researcher Sourajeet Majumder, the leaked data includes users' usernames, passwords, phone numbers, email addresses and their city and state of residence. Worryingly, the leaked passwords are in plain text, allowing Sourajeet to verify that the leaked details are genuine for a sample of 40 accounts whose details have been leaked. Network18-owned financial portal Moneycontrol, which has reported extensively about data breaches affecting companies such as Upstox and Mobikwik, seems to have suffered the same fate, as personal data of over 7 lakh users has allegedly been leaked on the dark web, where it's available for sale for $350. Worryingly, passwords stored in plain text have also been leaked, which prompted the company to reset the passwords of some users. Majumder has claimed that just a day after he made news of the data leak public on Twitter, Moneycontrol sent an email to some users, informing them that their password had been reset as it didn't comply with the platform's updated policy. Moneycontrol didn't respond to our queries about the data breach by the time of publication. The Moneycontrol data leak comes days after online discount broking platform Upstox suffered a data breach that allegedly affected 2.5 Mn users. A report by IBM's 'Cost of a Data Breach Report 2020' states that Indian companies witnessed an average $2 Mn total cost of a data breach in 2020, representing an increase of 9.4% from 2019.
