A data breach broker is selling a database that allegedly contains 25 million Mathway user records on a dark web marketplace. Earlier this month, cyber intelligence firm Cyble told BleepingComputer that they were tracking a potential data breach of Mathway after a purported database was being sold in private sales. This week, a data breach seller known as Shiny Hunters began to publicly sell an alleged Mathway database on a dark web marketplace for $4,000. Otherwise, the data is mostly what appears to be system data. Mathway told BleepingComputer that they are currently investigating the reports of a data breach. "We are aware of reports of a potential data compromise. We are working with cybersecurity experts to investigate further, and will take the appropriate steps to ensure the security of customer information." Mathway said in a statement to BleepingComputer. If you use Mathway and want to check if your account is part of this breach, you can use Cyble's AmIBreached data breach lookup service.
