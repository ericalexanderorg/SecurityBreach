Upon further investigation, we discovered that a threat actor had accessed data including Dropbox Sign customer information such as emails, usernames, phone numbers and hashed passwords, in addition to general account settings and certain authentication information such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication. If you created a Dropbox Sign or HelloSign account, but did not set up a password with us, no password was stored or exposed. From a technical perspective, Dropbox Sign's infrastructure is largely separate from other Dropbox services. Customer FAQ. I'm a Sign customer - what has Dropbox done to protect me and what do I need to do? We've expired your password and logged you out of any devices you had connected to Dropbox Sign to further protect your account. If you reused your Dropbox Sign password on any other services, we strongly recommend that you change your password on those accounts and utilize multi-factor authentication when available. If I have a Sign account linked to my Dropbox account, is my Dropbox account affected?
