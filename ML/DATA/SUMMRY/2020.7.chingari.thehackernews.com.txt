Following vulnerability disclosure in the Mitron app, another viral TikTok clone in India has now been found vulnerable to a critical but easy-to-exploit authentication bypass vulnerability, allowing anyone to hijack any user account and tamper with their information, content, and even upload unauthorized videos. Any Chingari User Account Can Be Hijacked in Seconds The Chingari app for iOS and Android asks users to register an account by granting basic profile access to their Google accounts, which is a standard part of OAuth-based authentication. According to Girish Kumar, a cybersecurity researcher at Encode Middle East firm in Dubai, Chingari uses a randomly generated user ID to fetch respective profile information and other data from its server without relying on any secret token for user authentication and authorization. Chingari Patch Update To Be Released Today Kumar responsibly disclosed the issue to the makers of Chingari earlier this week, and the company in response acknowledged the vulnerability. The Hacker News also reached out to Sumit Ghosh, founder of Chingari, who confirmed to the publication that the issue will be patched with Chingari version 2.4.1 for Android and 2.2.6 for iOS, that's expected to be rolled out to millions of its users via Google Play Store and Apple app store starting today. To protect users who don't update their app on time, the company has decided to disable access to the back-end APIs from older versions of the app. If you are a Chingari user, it's highly recommended that you update the app as soon as the latest version is available to avoid potential misuse.
