Threat actors targeted industrial suppliers in Japan and several European countries in sophisticated attacks, Kaspersky reported. Researchers from Kaspersky's ICS CERT unit reported that threat actors targeted industrial suppliers in Japan and several European countries in sophisticated attacks. The experts first observed the attacks in early 2020, while in early May, threat actors targeted organizations in Japan, Italy, Germany and the UK. Hackers targeted suppliers of equipment and software for industrial enterprises with spear-phishing messages using malicious Microsoft Office documents. "Phishing emails, used as the initial attack vector, were tailored and customized under the specific language for each specific victim. The malware used in this attack performed destructive activity only if the operating system had a localization that matched the language used in the phishing email." reads the report published by Kaspersky. Kaspersky experts only observed malicious activity on IT systems, OT networks were not impacted in the attacks. "The data is hidden in the image using steganographic techniques and is extracted by the malware from pixels defined by the algorithm. Using steganography enables the attackers to evade some security tools, including network traffic scanners." continues the analysis. "The use of the above techniques, combined with the pinpoint nature of the infections, indicates that these were targeted attacks. It is a matter of concern that attack victims include contractors of industrial enterprises. If the attackers are able to harvest the credentials of a contractor organization's employees, this can lead to a range of negative consequences, from the theft of sensitive data to attacks on industrial enterprises via remote administration tools used by the contractor."
