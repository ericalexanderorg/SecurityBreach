Premera Blue Cross will pay $6.9 million in a settlement with the Trump administration over a data breach that exposed confidential information on more than 10 million people across the country. Premera filed a breach report on March 17, 2015, on behalf of itself and its network of affiliates stating that cyberattackers had gained unauthorized access to its information technology system. During the breach, which went undetected for nearly nine months from May 2014 to January 2015, a hacker had unauthorized access to the Premera network containing 10.4 million individuals' protected health information including their names, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, Social Security numbers, bank account information and health plan clinical information, according to HHS. The hackers used a phishing email to install malware that gave them access to Premera's IT system. The insurer settled a $10 million lawsuit with 30 states in July 2019 over the 2014 breach. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson led a coalition of 30 state attorneys general investigating the company's practices following the 2014 health data breach that affected 10.4 million individuals nationwide and 6.4 million Washington state residents. In 2019 Premera also settled a federal class-action lawsuit for $74 million on behalf of affected customers of the breach. For years prior to the breach, cybersecurity experts and the company's own auditors repeatedly warned Premera about the vulnerabilities within its system including inadequate patching management but the company failed to fix the problems, according to Washington state's complaint against Premera filed after the breach.
