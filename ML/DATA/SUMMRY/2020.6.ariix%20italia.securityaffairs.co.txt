A database allegedly belonging to Ariix Italia was exposed online on an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket, it includes 30,000+ Italian sales agents' personal data. The database appears to belong to Ariix Italia, the recently launched Italian branch of Ariix, a US-based multi-level marketing company that advertises and sells health and wellness products. As of June 5, the Ariix Italia data bucket has been closed and is no longer accessible. At the time of discovery, the data bucket contained 7,515 PDF and 25,895 JPG files. At the moment, it is unclear if any bad actors have accessed the Ariix Italia S3 data bucket. As a precaution, Ariix Italia customers and sales representatives who have provided the company with their personal information should verify that their identities have not been used to commit fraud or other illegal activities. All of the document scans found in the unprotected Ariix data bucket are deeply sensitive, and most of them aremore than enough for an attacker to put up the victims' identities for sale on the black markets of the dark web or simply steal their money from credit cards.
