As you can see, during that time, we've made some major changes to the site, and though the design has changed substantially, we've made even more dramatic changes in the back-end. Our best guess is that someone was able to exploit a vulnerability in old, unmaintained code in the site's content management system, and made off with at least some user data, which may be as little as a few user records or, at worst, our entire database. To be perfectly honest, when contemplating what needed to be done to properly move the site to a new platform, I considered just throwing in the towel and going offline permanently. In order to keep your history from the old site, and to make that re-association process as painless as possible, we've written a very simple account migration tool. When you login to the new OSNews site, your password will be encrypted using a modern secure algorithm, which is currently PHP's password hash function, which uses Blowfish or Extended DES and can change over time so we don't repeat any past mistakes.
