AT&T has finally confirmed it is impacted by a data breach affecting 73 million current and former customers after initially denying the leaked data originated from them. While the company continues to say there is no indication their systems were breached, it has now confirmed that the leaked data belongs to 73 million current and former customers. "Based on our preliminary analysis, the data set appears to be from 2019 or earlier, impacting approximately 7.6 million current AT&T account holders and approximately 65.4 million former account holders," AT&T said in a statement shared with BleepingComputer. In 2021, a threat actor known as Shiny Hunters claimed to be selling the stolen data of 73 million AT&T customers. BleepingComputer has spoken to over 50 AT&T and DirectTV customers since the data was leaked, and they told us that the leaked data contains information that was only used for their AT&T accounts. These email addresses were confirmed not to be used on any other platform, indicating that the data had to have originated from DirectTV or AT&T. Troy Hunt also confirmed similar information from customers after the data was added to the Have I Been Pwned data breach notification service.
