North American land developer and home builder Brookfield Residential is one of the first victims of the new DarkSide Ransomware. Brookfield Residential is owned by Brookfield Asset Management, a Canadian asset management company with over $500 billion in assets under their control. The similar names have led to some confusion as to which entity was attacked by the DarkSide ransomware. DarkSide is an enterprise targeting ransomware that began operating around August 10th, 2020. As part of their extortion strategy, DarkSide will create an entry for each victim whose data has been stolen on their data leak site. Due to the similarity in names, DarkSide listed the wrong owner, and the actual victim is Brookfield Residential. As the stolen data for Brookfield Research has been released on DarkSide's data leak site, it is highly unlikely that a ransom was paid.
