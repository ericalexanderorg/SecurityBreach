Dr. Reddy's, the contractor for Russia's "Sputinik V" COVID-19 vaccine and a major generics producer, has had to close plants and isolate its data centers. COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has shut down its plants in Brazil, India, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. following a cyberattack, according to reports. Citing sources, ET said that the company was victimized by a data breach. The APT looks to pilfer COVID-19 vaccine research from academic and pharmaceutical institutions, in a likely attempt to get ahead on a cure for coronavirus, DHS warned. The federal government is supporting the development of Moderna's vaccine research, with nearly $1 billion invested and clinical trials underway. "There is strong interest from cyber attackers on the pharmaceutical industry as research and development efforts are focused on creating a vaccine for COVID-19," Chris Hazelton, Director of Security Solutions at Lookout, told Threatpost. "The first to market with a vaccine will have a significant competitive advantage, which is why there is a strong motive for IP theft in the pharmaceutical industry."
