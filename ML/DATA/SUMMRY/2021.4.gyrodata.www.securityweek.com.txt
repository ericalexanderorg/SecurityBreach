Oilfield services company Gyrodata last week revealed that it was recently targeted in a cyberattack that resulted in sensitive employee information being compromised. Houston, Texas-based Gyrodata provides surveying and wireline services for oil and gas, mining, and civil engineering projects. On February 21, the company discovered a piece of ransomware on its systems. The hackers appear to have gained access to servers storing information on current and former employees, including names, dates of birth, addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, W-2 tax forms, and health plan information. Gyrodata says it has started informing impacted individuals and providing free credit monitoring and identity protection services to those whose SSNs or driver's license numbers have been compromised. SecurityWeek has checked the leak websites of some of the most popular ransomware gangs, but did not find any mention of Gyrodata. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky last month reported that it had observed a drop in ransomware attacks on industrial control system computers in the second half of 2020, but saw an increase in these types of attacks in developed countries.
