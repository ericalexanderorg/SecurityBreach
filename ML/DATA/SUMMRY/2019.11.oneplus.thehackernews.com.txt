Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus has suffered a new data breach exposing personal and order information of an undisclosed number of its customers, likely, as a result of a vulnerability in its online store website. The breach came to light after OnePlus started informing affected customers via email and published a brief FAQ page to disclose information about the security incident. OnePlus also assured that not all customers were affected and that the attackers were not able to access any payment information, passwords, and associated accounts. Although the breach does not involve your OnePlus account password, you are still recommended to change the password for your account. Affected OnePlus customers should also be suspicious of phishing emails, which are usually the next step of cybercriminals in an attempt to trick users into giving away their passwords and credit card information. This isn't the first time OnePlus has reported a data breach. As The Hacker News reported back in January 2018, the company's website was hacked by an unknown attacker to steal credit card information belonging to up to 40,000 OnePlus customers.
