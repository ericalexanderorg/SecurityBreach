The FBI is working to track down the source of a ransomware attack on the Weslaco school district. Little information is being released beyond a statement from the Weslaco ISD acknowledging the district's computer network had been attacked by ransomware this morning. The district says it has made adjustments and students are being taught using online learning tools. Ransomware attacks typically block access to a computer system until a specified amount of money is paid.
