Digital banking app and tech unicorn Dave.com confirmed today a security breach after a hacker published the details of 7,516,625 users on a public forum. In an email to ZDNet today, Dave said the security breach originated on the network of a former business partner, Waydev, an analytics platform used by engineering teams. "As the result of a breach at Waydev, one of Dave's former third party service providers, a malicious party recently gained unauthorized access to certain user data at Dave," a spokesperson told ZDNet. "As soon as Dave became aware of this incident, the company immediately initiated an investigation, which is ongoing, and is coordinating with law enforcement, including with the FBI around claims by a malicious party that it has 'cracked' some of these passwords and is attempting to sell Dave customer data," Dave said. A reader tipped ZDNet that a hacker was offering the Dave app's user data on RAID, a hacking forum that has built a reputation for being the go-to place for hackers to leak databases. The Dave data is currently offered as a free download - after forum members unlock access to the download link using forum credits. For some users, it also includes payment card details and Social Security numbers, but Dave said these details were encrypted - which ZDNet confirmed after obtaining a copy of the data.
