Huntress Labs said the hack targeted Florida-based IT company Kaseya before spreading through corporate networks that use its software. Kaseya said in a statement on its own website that it was investigating a "Potential attack". Huntress Labs said it believed the Russia-linked REvil ransomware gang was responsible. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, a federal agency, said in a statement that it was taking action to address the attack. Kaseya said one of its applications that runs corporate servers, desktop computers and network devices might have been compromised. Kaseya said in its statement that a "Small number" of companies had been affected, though Huntress Labs said the number is already about 200 and counting. Kaseya's website says it has a presence in over 10 countries and more than 10,000 customers.
