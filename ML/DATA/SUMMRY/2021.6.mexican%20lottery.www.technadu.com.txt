Avaddon hit the Mexican state lottery agency and is already leaking sensitive documents on the site. The government responded by blocking access to all foreign IP addresses, hoping to defend against subsequent DDoS attacks. The Lotería Nacional and Pronósticos sites have shut access to any IP address outside Mexico, following a troublesome encounter with the Avaddon ransomware gang. The sites are still accessible via VPN, but based on what we see on the Avaddon leaks portal, they may not remain up for much longer, as the hackers are threatening to DDoS them ten days from now. The entity is a government-run national lottery system, so the attack isn't against a private company but a national economic resource. Blocking access to foreign IP addresses is an interesting approach when it comes to defending against DDoS attacks, as we doubt that Avaddon would be able to contract Mexican hackers to launch them. Avaddon continues to be one of the most prolific ransomware gangs of 2021, hitting a large number of small to medium-sized organizations and occasionally bringing down some more notable entities like the Mexican Lotería Nacional.
