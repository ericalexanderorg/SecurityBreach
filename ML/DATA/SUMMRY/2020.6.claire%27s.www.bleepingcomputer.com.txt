The websites for U.S. based jewelry and accessory giant Claire's, and its subsidiary Icing, were compromised in April and may have allowed hackers to gain access to customer's credit cards. Claire's is a very popular U.S. based jewelry and accessories store with over 2,000 locations in North America and Europe, and 6,794 concession locations and 546 franchised stores in other regions. The Claire's stores are commonly found in shopping malls around the United States and are very popular among teenage girls and young women. In a new report by cybersecurity firm Sansec, Claire's website was compromised by attackers who attempted to steal customer's payment information when purchasing from the site. A day after Claire's shut down all of their brick and mortars worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic, threat actors created a domain named 'claires-assets.com. According to the Sansec researchers, this malicious script was attempting to steal customers' credit cards at least between April 30th and June 13th. Sansec's Willem de Groot told BleepingComptuer that Claire's acknowledged receiving their report, and had removed the malicious code on Saturday. Any customers who made purchases on Claire's between April 30th and June 13th, should contact their credit card company and monitor statements for fraudulent purchases to be safe.
