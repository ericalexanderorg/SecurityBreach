Hackers breached "Various point of sales terminals" at retailer Forever 21's storefronts throughout the country, collecting "Credit card numbers, expiration dates, verification codes and sometimes cardholder names" from April 3rd to November 18th, 2017, CNET reported. In a notification to customers, Forever 21 said that "We regret this incident occurred and any concern this may have caused you." It explained that when encryption was turned off on a system that logged payment card details from transactions, malware installed on its point of sales systems was able to transmit that data to the hackers. The company originally disclosed a notice of possible "Unauthorized access to data from payment cards that were used at certain Forever 21 stores" in November, though it did not provide specific details about the attack. There have been so many major breaches of consumer data in recent years that it's hard to keep track. As CNET noted, sophisticated attacks on retail point of sales devices continued to rack up this year, with other affected companies including Chipotle and Gamestop. Cybercriminals sometimes market stolen credit card information on deep web forums hidden from less technically inclined web users. Cards which are identified as valid are then used to purchase expensive items like travel packages or gift cards.
