Michigan State University today disclosed that attackers were able to steal credit card and personal information from roughly 2,600 users of its shop. Such attacks are known as web skimming attacks and are usually the result of attackers being able to deploy card skimmer scripts on e-commerce sites via compromised admin accounts. "An unauthorized party gained access to Michigan State University's online store, shop.msu.edu, and placed malicious code to expose shoppers' credit card numbers between Oct. 19, 2019 and June 26, 2020," MSU said today in a statement. "Once the university was notified, an initial investigation determined the exposed information included names, addresses and credit card numbers of about 2,600 customers." The university says that no Social Security numbers were stolen during the nine months the attackers had access to the shop. If consumers believe they may have been impacted by this incident and have not received an official notice from the university by Aug. 30, they are encouraged to call the university at 517-355-1855. MSU is notifying all potentially affected customers of the data breach and is offering all of them free identity protection and credit monitoring.
