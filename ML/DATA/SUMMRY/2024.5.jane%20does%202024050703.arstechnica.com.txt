Kremlin-backed hackers have been exploiting a critical Microsoft vulnerability for four years in attacks that targeted a vast array of organizations with a previously undocumented tool, the software maker disclosed Monday. When Microsoft patched the vulnerability in October 2022-at least two years after it came under attack by the Russian hackers-the company made no mention that it was under active exploitation. Windows users frequently prioritize the installation of patches based on whether a vulnerability is likely to be exploited in real-world attacks. Exploiting CVE-2022-38028, as the vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to gain system privileges, the highest available in Windows, when combined with a separate exploit. Microsoft said at the time that it learned of the vulnerability from the US National Security Agency. The post-exploitation malware elevates privileges within a compromised system and goes on to provide a simple interface for installing additional pieces of malware that also run with system privileges. GooseEgg is typically installed using a simple batch script, which is executed following the successful exploitation of CVE-2022-38028 or another vulnerability, such as CVE-2023-23397, which Monday's advisory said has also been exploited by Forest Blizzard.
