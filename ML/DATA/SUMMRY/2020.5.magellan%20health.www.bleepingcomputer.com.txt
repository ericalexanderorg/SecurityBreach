Fortune 500 company Magellan Health Inc announced today that it was the victim of a ransomware attack on April 11, 2020, which led to the theft of personal information from one of its corporate servers. Magellan Health is a for-profit managed health care and insurance firm that ranks 417 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest US corporations by total revenue. "On April 11, 2020, Magellan discovered it was targeted by a ransomware attack. The unauthorized actor gained access to Magellan's systems after sending a phishing email on April 6 that impersonated a Magellan client," Magellan SVP & Chief Compliance Officer John J. DiBernardi Jr says in a breach notification notice filed with the office of the Attorney General of California. As the investigation unveiled, the threat actors behind the ransomware attack were able to steal and exfiltrate "a subset of data from a single Magellan corporate server," including sensitive personal information. Magellan Health was recently the target of a criminal ransomware attack on our company network, which resulted in a temporary systems outage and the exfiltration of certain confidential company and personal information. Last year, Magellan also disclosed on September 17 and November 27 that Magellan Rx Management, National Imaging Associates, and Magellan Healthcare, three of its subsidiaries, were affected by potential data reaches following phishing attacks. The compromised email accounts "Contained information which may have included member's name, date of birth, health plan member ID#, health plan, provider, diagnosis, drug, and authorization information," according to Magellan.
