Online fashion store SHEIN announced a security breach last week that affected around 6.42 million of its customerbase. The company says the breach occurred over the summer, sometime in June, when hackers carried out "a sophisticated criminal cyberattack on its computer network."

No technical details were provided about how the actual breach went down, but SHEIN said the intruders managed to gain access to customers' email addresses and encrypted passwords for its online store accounts. The company discovered the incident on August 22, according to a press release SHEIN circulated on Friday, September 21. "We have seen no evidence that your credit card information was taken from our systems and SHEIN typically does not store credit card information on its systems," the company said in an advisory posted on its website. By the way SHEIN described the incident, this breach doesn't appear to be related to the recent wave of Magecart hacks -incidents where hackers placed card-stealing code inside the JavaScript files of legitimate sites. SHEIN, also spelled SheIn, is a US-based online store dedicated to women's fashion.
