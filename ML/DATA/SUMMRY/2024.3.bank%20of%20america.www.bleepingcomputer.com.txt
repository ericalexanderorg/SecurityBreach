While Bank of America has yet to disclose how many customers were impacted by the data breach, Infosys McCamish Systems, the vendor that had its systems compromised, revealed in a recent filing with the Attorney General of Maine that 57,028 had their data exposed in the incident. "On November 24, 2023, IMS told Bank of America that data concerning deferred compensation plans serviced by Bank of America may have been compromised. Bank of America's systems were not compromised." IMS said the security breach led to a "Non-availability of certain applications and systems in IMS" when it first disclosed the incident in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
