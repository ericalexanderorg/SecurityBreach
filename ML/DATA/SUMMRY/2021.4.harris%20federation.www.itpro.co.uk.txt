The incident, which took place over the weekend, comes just days after the University of Northampton fell victim to a cyber attack and follows a worrying trend of hackers targeting educational institutions and disrupting student learning, which has already been heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The recent increase in cyber attacks on educational institutions has prompted the National Cyber Security Centre to issue an alert urging organisations to follow its guidance on 'Mitigating malware and ransomware. NCSC director of operations Paul Chichester labelled the targeting of the education sector by cyber criminals as "Completely unacceptable". "We are committed to ensuring the UK education sector is resilient against cyber threats, and have published practical resources to help establishments improve their cyber security and response to cyber incidents." Commenting on the Harris Federation ransomware attack, Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of security company ImmuniWeb said that, "Unlike large universities, which can afford spending considerable budgets on cybersecurity, primary schools often struggle to get budgets even for the very foundational security controls, let alone advance cyber defense solutions". Kolochenko urged the UK government to "Urgently intervene with cyber training, financial and technical support in the UK educational sector". "Law enforcement agencies require undelayed financial support to attract new professionals, align forensic capacities with modern cyber threats and perform educational support and awareness among future victims."
