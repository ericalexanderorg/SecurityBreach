CDK Global, a company that provides software for thousands of auto dealers in the U.S. and Canada, was hit by back-to-back cyberattacks Wednesday. CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry. CDK serves more than 15,000 retail locations across North America, according to the company. In messages to its customers, the company has also warned of "Bad actors" posing as members or affiliates of CDK to try to obtain system access by contacting customers. Several major auto companies - including Stellantis, Ford and BMW - confirmed to The Associated Press last week that the CDK outage had impacted some of their dealers, but that sales operations continue. In regulatory filings, Lithia Motors and AutoNation disclosed that last week's incident at CDK had disrupted their operations as well. If you've bought a car from a dealership that's used CDK software, cybersecurity security experts stress that it's important to assume your data may have been breached.
