The personally identifiable information of more than 99,000 customers of Las Vegas-based diet-supplement and exercise-program company V Shred may have been left exposed online due to an insecure database. V Shred describes itself as a fast-growing "Fitness, nutrition and supplement brand" with tens of thousands of customers in 119 countries and 12 million unique website visitors. According to the researchers, the unsecured photos and documents "Contained various pieces of personally identifiable information data that revealed sensitive information about the people exposed." One contained 96,000 entries from a sales-lead-generation list; the second contained 3,522 entries from an email-address list; and the third contained the personal information of 52 trainers who worked for or with the company. The researchers contacted V Shred and AWS to alert them of the breach in May, but V Shred took a month to remove the files containing personal information from the AWS bucket. The fitness firm told VPNMentor that it "Would be leaving all other files publicly accessible" because V Shred customers needed to be able to access their meal plans, workout instructions and before-and-after photos. "VPNMentor's report added:"V Shred is a young company and appears to be run by a small team.
