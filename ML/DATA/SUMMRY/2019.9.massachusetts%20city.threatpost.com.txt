After a ransomware attack slapped a hefty payout demand of $5.3 million on New Bedford, Mass., the city announced that it is instead opting to pick up the pieces and restore what it can from backups itself. "On Friday, July 5, 2019, the City of New Bedford's Management Information Systems staff identified and disrupted a computer virus attack, known as ransomware, in the early morning hours before city employees began the work day," according to a New Bedford press release. "The city's MIS department has now completely rebuilt the city's server network, restored most software applications, and replaced all of the computer workstations that were found to be affected. The attack did not disrupt the city's delivery of services to residents. The city's MIS staff is now addressing the internal impact on city government." "The specific virus was a variant of the Ryuk virus, a ransomware virus whose purpose is the financial extortion of a computer network's operator - in this case, the City of New Bedford," according to the city's release. In June, dual Florida cities - Lake City and Riviera Beach - were both hit by ransomware attacks and decided to pay off the hackers. The city of Baltimore meanwhile is another high-profile recent victim of ransomware, which hit in May and halted some city services like water bills, permits and more, with attackers demanding a $76,000 ransom. In 2018, several Atlanta city systems were infamously crippled after a ransomware attack extorted the municipality for $51,000.
