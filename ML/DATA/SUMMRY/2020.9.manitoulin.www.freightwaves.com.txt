A hacking group posted data stolen from Manitoulin Transport, one of Canada's largest trucking companies, on Friday in the latest in a string of ransomware attacks targeting firms in the country's supply chain. Ransomware data leaks target six Canadian supply chain firms in less than a month. Manitoulin Transport is the sixth Canadian supply chain company to see its data posted by ransomware groups in less than a month. On Monday, a different hacking group posted additional leaked data from TFI International's Canpar Express after an August ransomware attack targeted the company's parcel and courier subsidiaries. Ransomware attacks typically involve hackers breaching companies' systems and then noticing their data. The six recent attacks involving Canadian supply chain companies only represent incidents in which the hackers leaked data in response to not getting paid. Manitoulin Transport is Canada's 14th-largest trucking company with 745 tractors, according to an annual ranking by Today's Trucking.
