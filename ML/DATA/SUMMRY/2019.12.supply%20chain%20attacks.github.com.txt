This repository contains links to articles of software supply chain compromises. The goal is not to catalog every known supply chain attack, but rather to capture many examples of different kinds of attack, so that we can better understand the patterns and develop best practices and tools. We welcome additions to this catalog by filing an issue or github pull request.
