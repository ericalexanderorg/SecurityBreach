Cloud-based human resources company ComplyRight said this week that a security breach of its Web site may have jeopardized sensitive consumer information - including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and Social Security numbers - from tax forms submitted by the company's thousands of clients on behalf of employees. Pompano Beach, Fla-based ComplyRight began mailing breach notification letters to affected consumers late last week, but the form letters are extremely vague about the scope and cause of the breach. On Wednesday evening, ComplyRight posted additional facts about the incident on its site, saying a recently completed investigation suggests that fewer than 10 percent of individuals with tax forms prepared on the ComplyRight platform were impacted. ComplyRight includes information about its tax solutions division here and it appears that they also file Affordable Care Act and HIPAA paperwork. Again, neither ComplyRight nor its parent firm responded to multiple requests for comment. People who received a letter from ComplyRight may also file a Form 14039 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to help reduce the likelihood of becoming victims of tax refund fraud, an increasingly common scam in which fraudsters file a tax refund request with the IRS in your name and then pocket the refund money. Update, July 23, 8:00 a.m. ET: In a breach notice sent to Wisconsin's department of consumer protection, ComplyRight said its data breach affected 662,000 people.
