Online exam proctoring solution ProctorU has confirmed a data breach after a threat actor released a stolen database of user records on a hacker forum. ProctorU is a proctoring service used by companies and colleges to monitor online tests for cheating. Last month, BleepingComputer broke the story that a known data breach seller had leaked 18 company's databases for free on a hacker forum. One of the leaked databases was for Proctoru.com and contains user records for 444,000 people allegedly registered at the online proctoring service. The samples of the database seen by BleepingComputer contains email addresses, full names, addresses, phone numbers, hashed passwords, the affiliated organization, and other information. In a tweeted reply to the University of Sydney student newspaper Honi Soit, who further investigated our report, ProctorU confirmed that they suffered a data breach for records from 2014 and are investigating the incident. In our analysis of the database users are shown who created ProctorU accounts in other years, including 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and even 2017.
