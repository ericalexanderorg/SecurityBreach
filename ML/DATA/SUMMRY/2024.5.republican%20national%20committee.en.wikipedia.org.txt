Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike also previously suggested that it may be associated with either the Russian Federal Security Service or SVR. The group has been given various nicknames by other cybersecurity firms, including CozyCar, CozyDuke , Dark Halo, The Dukes, Midnight Blizzard , NOBELIUM, Office Monkeys, StellarParticle, UNC2452, and YTTRIUM. On 20 December 2020, it was reported that Cozy Bear was responsible for a cyber attack on U.S. sovereign national data, believed to be at the direction of the Russian government. The speed at which Cozy Bear develops and deploys its components is reminiscent of the toolset of Fancy Bear, which also uses the tools CHOPSTICK and CORESHELL. Cozy Bear's CozyDuke malware toolset is structurally and functionally similar to second stage components used in early Miniduke, Cosmicduke, and OnionDuke operations. In June 2016, Cozy Bear was implicated alongside the hacker group Fancy Bear in the Democratic National Committee cyber attacks. A CrowdStrike forensic team determined that while Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been there a few weeks. In February 2017, it was revealed that Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch ministries, including the Ministry of General Affairs, over the previous six months. Suspicions that Cozy Bear had ceased operations were dispelled in 2019 by the discovery of three new malware families attributed to Cozy Bear: PolyglotDuke, RegDuke and FatDuke. Washington Post sources identified Cozy Bear as the group responsible for the attack.
