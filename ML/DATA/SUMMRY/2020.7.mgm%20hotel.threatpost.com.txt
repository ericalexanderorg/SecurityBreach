Researchers have found 142 million personal details from former guests at the MGM Resorts hotels for sale on the dark web, evidence that a data leak from the hotel chain last summer may be far bigger in scope than previously thought. An advertisement on a hacker forum has put 142,479,937 details from "MGM Grand Hotels" guests up for sale for more than $2,900, according to a published report on ZDNet. In the ad, the hacker makes a connection between the advertised credentials to a leak of personal details of more than 10.6 million guests who stayed at MGM Resorts. As there is no "MGM Grand Hotels" in the chain-merely the MGM Grand and the parent company MGM Resorts-it's not entirely clear from which hotels specifically the 142 million credentials being sold online came. The latest cache of142 million MGM details are the result of a breach of DataViper, a data leak monitoring service operated by Night Lion Security, the hacker claimed in the ad. ZDNet detailed that theft in a separate report Monday, in which a hacker claimed to have breached the backend servers from Night Lion and stolen more than 8,200 databases containing the information of billions of users that leaked from other companies during past security breaches. It's also unclear if the 10.6 million credentials from MGM Resorts posted to a hacking forum earlier this year is included in the database of 142 million currently up for sale or if they are two separate data stores. There is evidence that the breach could have affected up to 200 million MGM clients, according to Tuesday's ZDNet report, which cited posts on Russian-speaking hacking forums promoting the sale of even more MGM credentials.
