SonicWall has deployed patches for three zero-day vulnerabilities in its email security tools and reports at least one known instance in which these flaws were exploited in an active attack. The vulnerabilities exist in SonicWall Email Security, an email security tool built to protect inbound and outbound messages and defend against advanced threats like ransomware, spear-phishing, and business email compromise. In a disclosure, SonicWall says the bugs affect both its hosted and on-premises email security products. The system was a SonicWall ES application running on a Windows 2012 installation, and a Web shell was being served via the HTTPS-enabled Apache Tomcat Web server bundled with SonicWall ES. Because the Web shell was served in the application's bundled Web server, they suspected the compromise was linked to SonicWall ES. The response team learned the SonicWall ES installation was 10.0.9, the latest version available, and there were no known vulnerabilities or active attacks. Both the attackers and the target organization are unidentified, though Mandiant notes whoever is responsible is deeply familiar with SonicWall ES, as indicated by the fact they cleared the latest application-level log entries recorded by the SonicWall ES Web application. The SonicWall Hosted Email Security tool was automatically updated for all users, so no additional action is required. Like SonicWall, Ivanti had also been working with Mandiant, along with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other organizations to respond to the exploits.
