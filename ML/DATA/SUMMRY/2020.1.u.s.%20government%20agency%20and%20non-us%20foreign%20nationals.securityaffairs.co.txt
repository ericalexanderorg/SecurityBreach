A US Government agency was hit with a phishing attack attempting to deliver a new malware dropper dubbed CARROTBALL. Security experts at Palo Alto Networks have uncovered a new malware dropper called CARROTBALL that was used in targeted attacks against a U.S. government agency and non-US foreign nationals. "The malware families used in this campaign consisted mainly of malicious documents featuring CARROTBAT downloaders with SYSCON payloads, but also included a new malware downloader Unit 42 has dubbed CARROTBALL.". Five documents involved in the campaign contained CARROTBAT downloaders, and one contained a CARROTBALL downloader. Experts noticed that all of the malicious documents used in the campaign used the same macro that allowed attackers to determine the target Windows architecture, execute a command that was hidden in a textbox included in the document and then clear the contents of the textboxes and save the document. In the last wave of the campaign, attackers used a different macro that doesn't execute commands hidden in the document, instead it relied on an embedded Windows binary. The name "Konni" identifies a Remote Access Trojan used in targeted campaigns carried out by North Korea-linked APT groups. "Overall, the Fractured Statue campaign provides clear evidence that the TTPS discovered in Fractured Block are still relevant, and that the group behind the attacks still appears to be active." concludes the report.
