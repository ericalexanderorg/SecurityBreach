The attacks have hit several air transportation and government victims in hopes of data exfiltration. The Chafer APT has been active since 2014 and has previously launched cyber espionage campaigns targeting critical infrastructure in the Middle East. "Researchers have found attacks conducted by this actor in the Middle East region, dating back to 2018," according to a Thursday Bitdefender analysis. While the modus operandi behind the attacks against firms in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia shared "Some common stages," researchers noted that the attacks on victims from Kuwait were more sophisticated as attackers were able to move laterally on the network. One of these components was the same as the backdoor used on the targeted attacks in Kuwait - leading researchers to link the two campaigns. Researchers linked these campaigns with Chafer because some of the tools used bear similarities to the tools used in previously-documented Chafer APT attacks. It's only the latest campaign for the Chafer APT. Last year, the Iran-linked APT was spotted targeting various entities based in Iran with an enhanced version of a custom malware that takes a very unique approach to communication by using the Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service mechanism over HTTP. Another campaign in February, launched by two Iran-backed APTs who were possibly working together to compromise high-value organizations from the IT, telecom, oil and gas, aviation, government and security sectors in Israel, was loosely linked to the Chafin APT after researchers noted an overlap in approaches.
