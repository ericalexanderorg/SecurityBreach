Using an exploit in an older version of Microsoft SQL Server, cyberattackers successfully deployed ransomware in Dennis Group's network. The attack had the marks of professional cybercriminals, said Calen Burr, director of IT at Dennis Group. Its primary function is to serve as a cloud-based NAS file system for sharing and collaboration across Dennis Group's eight offices, but it has several built-in features such as instant recovery, data protection and ransomware mitigation. Burr used logs and auditing from security software Dennis Group had at the time to determine when exactly the intrusion occurred, then had Nasuni roll back to before that point. Dennis Group is an engineering firm that designs and builds food processing facilities. The actual business impact of the ransomware attack was minimal, but it kicked off a wave of IT security initiatives at Dennis Group, Burr said. Most of the recoveries Dennis Group performs using Nasuni aren't from cyberattacks, but from accidental deletions and overwrites, Burr said.
