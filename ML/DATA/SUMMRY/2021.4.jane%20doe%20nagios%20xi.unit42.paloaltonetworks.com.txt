On March 16, 2021, Unit 42 researchers observed an attacker targeting Nagios XI software to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2021-25296, a remote command injection vulnerability impacting Nagios XI version 5.7.5, to conduct a cryptojacking attack and deploy the XMRig coinminer on victims' devices. Upgrading Nagios XI to the latest version mitigates the vulnerability. A command injection vulnerability allows attackers to inject unexpected characters or arbitrary commands to the original command to execute the injected commands. Due to the lack of validation of the user input of the configuration of the "Configuration Wizard: Windows WMI" component, Nagios XI version 5.7.5 is prone to CVE-2021-25296, a remote command injection vulnerability. Extracted from the request is directly appended to the commands before the commands are executed, leading to a command injection vulnerability. Will be treated as an argument to the original command and mitigates the command injection vulnerability. The attack in the wild targeting Nagios XI 5.7.5 exploits CVE-2021-25296 and drops a cryptocurrency miner, threatening the security of the systems that have out-of-date Nagios XI software deployed.
