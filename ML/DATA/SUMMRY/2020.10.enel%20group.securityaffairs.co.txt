The news of a possible ransomware attack against Enel Group was reported to BleepingComputer by a researcher on October 19. The researcher shared with BleepingComputer a Netwalker ransom note that appeared to be used in the attack on Enel Group. Enel never replied to the message of the ransomware operators, for this reason, the attackers started leaking a portion of the stolen data as proof of the data breach. Today, the Netwalker ransomware operators added Enel Group to their data leak site and some screenshots of unencrypted files stolen from the company.
