NORMAL - Heartland Community College is using a recent cyberattack to make sure people are protecting themselves online. School staff discovered the breach on October 5th, after an outside source tried getting in to the school's systems. This marks the first disruption of this size for the school. Heartland Community College Public Information Director Steve Fast is glad for their team's response. He adds it's a reminder for everyone on campus to keep their digital presence secure. "The most vulnerable point of security is at the source of your passwords, your access, and you have to take preventative measures...to secure your own data." In the meantime, the school is combing through to make sure their computer infrastructure is better and safer.
