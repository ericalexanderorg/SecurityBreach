Based on files uploaded to the VirusTotal scanning service, the ransomware attack on the City of New Orleans was likely done by the Ryuk Ransomware threat actors. On December 14th, 2019, one day after the City of New Orleans ransomware attack, what appear to be memory dumps of suspicious executables were uploaded from an IP address from the USA to the VirusTotal scanning service. One of these memory dumps, which contained numerous references to New Orleans and Ryuk, was later found by Colin Cowie of Red Flare Security and shared with BleepingComputer.com. Exe' and contains numerous references to the City of New Orleans including domain names, domain controllers, internal IP addresses, user names, file shares, and references to the Ryuk ransomware. While it is not known if this executable is the one used in the City of New Orleans attack, it does show that this filename is used in Ryuk attacks and the memory dumps show that a file of that name was used on an attack against the City of New Orleans. If the City of New Orleans was indeed encrypted by Ryuk, which by the evidence seems likely, then this is just another victim of Ryuk who has seen increased activity lately. If New Orleans was encrypted by Ryuk, there is also a very high chance that the Emotet and TrickBot infections are present on the network as well.
