One bad search on the government website for South Carolina's capital city could've exposed an entire database. The city of Columbia site had a security flaw in its search tool, according to independent security researcher Arif Khan. The flaw let anyone view passwords for the website's database and email protocol servers, creating a massive potential for abuse, Khan said on Thursday. The vulnerability made it possible for someone to "Pull sensitive data out of the Columbia city government's database," Khan said. With access to the email protocol servers, an attacker could've also created spoof emails that looked like they'd come from the city government. He reached out again in October, he said, and another security researcher also publicly contacted the city government in November on Twitter. Cybercriminals often target city governments because they serve an important function and have access to sensitive information.
