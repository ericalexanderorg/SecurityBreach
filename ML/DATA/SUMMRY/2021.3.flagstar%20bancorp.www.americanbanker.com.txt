Flagstar Bancorp fell victim to a recent data breach in which personal information of employees and customers, including Social Security numbers and mailing addresses, was leaked and the thieves sought to extort some employees. Public pressure on banks is only building as consumers say they care heavily about how the companies they work with protect their data. "So if you're a bank and you have third parties that are using Accellion FTA and they were hacked, you have a responsibility to make sure that your customers' data is secure." Some of the victims of the Accellion data breach were law firms. In most such cases during the past year, they would start shutting down systems and encrypting data, then start using the stolen data for extortion. "It's a very difficult situation, because if you don't pay, invariably what the attacker will do is start releasing data, which potentially can cause some harm to customers. As the bank, the best thing you could do is find out what data was there, do forensic analysis, and then notify customers." A standard breach response for banks is to provide customers with free credit monitoring for a year, so in theory they can see if their account data is being used to take out loans or credit cards.
