Marriott International has today announced that it has suffered a data breach affecting up to 5.2 million people. When the breach was discovered at the end of February, Marriott International says it disabled those login credentials and began its investigation. Marriott says there is currently no reason to believe the information accessed included Marriott Bonvoy account passwords or PINs, payment card information, passport information, national IDs, or driver's license numbers. It says it's giving guests the option of accessing a data monitoring service for a year. What to do Marriott International has set up a self-service portal for you to be able to determine if and what information of yours was accessed. If your information was involved, Marriott has disabled your password and you'll be prompted to enter a new one when you next log in. Don't click on any links, and verify anything you encounter by heading directly to the official breach website or calling the official call centre numbers.
