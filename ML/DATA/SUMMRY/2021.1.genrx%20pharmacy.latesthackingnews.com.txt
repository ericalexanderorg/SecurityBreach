A huge cyberattack affecting the American GenRx Pharmacy potentially resulted in a data breach. Through a recent press release, GenRx Pharmacy, a healthcare facility headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, has disclosed a data breach. The pharmacy has blamed a ransomware attack for the breach that hit its network lately. Together with forensic experts, the pharmacy terminated the cybercriminals' access to the pharmacy's systems the same day and confirmed that an unauthorized third party deployed the ransomware only one day before. The stolen data included the health information of some patients that the pharmacy collected to manage the shipment of prescribed products. The cybercriminals accessed and removed the following health information of certain former GenRx patients: patient ID, transaction ID, first and last name, address, phone number, date of birth, gender, allergies, medication list, health plan information, and prescription information. Patients' financial data and SSNs remained safe as the pharmacy doesn't collect this information.
