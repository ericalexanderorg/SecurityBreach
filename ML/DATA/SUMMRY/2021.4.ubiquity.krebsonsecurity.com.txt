For four days this past week, Internet-of-Things giant Ubiquiti failed to respond to requests for comment on a whistleblower's allegations the company had massively downplayed a "Catastrophic" two-month breach ending in January to save its stock price, and that Ubiquiti's insinuation that a third-party was to blame was a fabrication. All of a sudden, local-only networks were being connected to Ubiquiti's cloud, giving rise to countless discussion threads on Ubiquiti's user forums from customers upset over the potential for introducing new security risks. On Jan. 11, Ubiquiti gave weight to that angst: It told customers to reset their passwords and enable multifactor authentication, saying a breach involving a third-party cloud provider might have exposed user account data. Ubiquiti told customers they were "Not currently aware of evidence of access to any databases that host user data, but we cannot be certain that user data has not been exposed." On Tuesday, KrebsOnSecurity reported that a source who participated in the response to the breach said Ubiquiti should have immediately invalidated all credentials because all of the company's key administrator passwords had been compromised as well. Adam says the attacker(s) had access to privileged credentials that were previously stored in the LastPass account of a Ubiquiti IT employee, and gained root administrator access to all Ubiquiti AWS accounts, including all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on cookies. While it may seem that Ubiquiti is quibbling over whether data was in fact stolen, Adam said Ubiquiti can say there is no evidence that customer information was accessed because Ubiquiti failed to keep logs of who was accessing its databases.
