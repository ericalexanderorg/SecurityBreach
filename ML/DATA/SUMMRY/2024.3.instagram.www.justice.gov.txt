LOS ANGELES - A downtown Los Angeles man was sentenced today to 96 months in federal prison for committing a series of frauds, including one in which he "SIM swapped" victims - one of them a social media influencer - to hijack their Instagram accounts to unlawfully obtain money. From at least April 2019 to February 2023, Golshan knowingly executed multiple online schemes to defraud hundreds of victims through various online scams and unauthorized intrusions into victims' digital accounts, including social media account takeovers, Zelle payment fraud, and impersonating Apple support. In December 2021, a Los Angeles-based model and influencer with more than 100,000 followers on social media, received a direct message on Instagram from her friend's account, stating, "Can you do me a favor? What's your number?" The victim provided her phone number to the person whom she believed was her friend, but who really was Golshan. Golshan then logged into the victim's Instagram account without authorization, impersonated the victim to her friends, and requested the victim's friends send him money through Zelle, PayPal and other online payment platforms. During the time that Golshan locked the victim out of her accounts, he sent her messages demanding $2,000 for the return of her accounts and threatening to delete her accounts if she did not pay him. In August 2019, for example, Golshan falsely represented on Instagram that he could provide a verified Instagram badge for one victim's teenage daughter in exchange for $300. Golshan knew this statement was false and that only Instagram could provide such a badge. During Golshan's SIM swapping and Zelle fraud schemes, Golshan fraudulently received approximately $82,000 in payments from approximately 500 victims, usually in increments of $300 to $500 per victim.
