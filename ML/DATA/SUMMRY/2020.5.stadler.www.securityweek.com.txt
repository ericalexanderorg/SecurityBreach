Railway rolling stock manufacturer Stadler Rail is currently investigating a malware attack that forced some of its systems offline. Last week, the Swiss manufacturer announced that what appears to be a professional threat actor was able to compromise its network with malware and to exfiltrate an unknown amount of data. "Stadler internal surveillance services found out that the company's IT network has been attacked by malware which has most likely led to a data leak. The scale of this leak has to be further analyzed," the company said in a press release. The company did not provide details on the type of malware used in the attack, but revealed that the miscreants were attempting to extort money from Stadler by threatening to make stolen data public, in an attempt to "Harm Stadler and thereby also its employees". Stadler also revealed that the affected systems were being rebooted, and underlined that its backup systems are functioning. The company's mentioning of systems having to be restored and of backup data suggests that ransomware might have been used in the attack. Ransomware operators such as those behind Maze have been stealing victim data and have attempted to extort more money by threatening to make it public in the event a ransom is not paid, and the attack described by Stadler fits the pattern.
