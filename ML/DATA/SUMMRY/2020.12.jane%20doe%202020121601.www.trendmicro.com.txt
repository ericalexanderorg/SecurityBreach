We have already published findings on the SLUB malware's past campaigns. In our latest research paper, we uncovered a recent watering hole campaign that involves a new variant of the malware. We found Operation Earth Kitsune using a total of five C&C servers, seven samples, and four new bugs, aiming to compromise websites to host malware. Users who accessed the said site were redirected to a weaponized version of a proof of concept for the CVE-2019-5782 Google Chrome vulnerability published in the chromium tracking system. Digging deeper, we discovered that the attack does not only involve a weaponized version of the mentioned Chrome exploit; the exploit was infecting the victim machine with three separate malware samples. Besides the aforementioned behavior, the campaign was also seen exploiting other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2016-0189Â¸ CVE-2019-1458, and the vulnerabilities cited in our previous reports on SLUB. Like the aforementioned affected sites, the compromised servers are using the GNUBoard Content Management System, some of them on either version 4 or version 5. While SLUB's objective in this campaign is to exfiltrate system information, the two other malware variants were deployed to gain additional control of the affected user's machine.
