The Parliament of Finland confirmed that threat actors had access to email accounts of multiple members of parliament. "Parliament of Finland has been subjected to a cyberattack in the fall of 2020. The attack was discovered by parliament technical surveillance. Some parliament e-mail accounts may have been compromised as a result of the attack, among them e-mail accounts that belong to MPs." Parliament officials said. "The cyberattack is being investigated by the National Bureau of Investigation. The investigation is supported by Parliament of Finland." The attack took place in the fall of 2020, in the same period Russia-linked hackers accessed the emails and data of a small number of Norwegians parliamentary representatives and employees. Foreign hackers broke into the internal IT system and accessed email accounts for some MPs. The Finnish Central Criminal Police is investigating the security breach with the support of the Parliament. According to KRP Commissioner Tero Muurman, the attack is likely part of a cyberespionage campaign carried out by nation-state actors, but it did not cause any damage to the Parliament's infrastructure. In October, the Norwegian police secret service blamed Russia-linked cyberespionage group APT28 for the cyber attack that targeted the email system of the country's parliament in August.
