A security vulnerability in a popular enterprise remote access product is being used to deliver ransomware into organisations, with targeted delivery to also delete backups and disable endpoint security controls. As you can imagine with updates outside the Windows ecosystem, organisations are terrible at applying patches properly. Those results included networks at governments across the world - many incredibly sensitive organisations included - and basically a list of the world's largest companies. Since then Bad Packets has been working with CERTs, CSIRTs and ISACs and related government groups to share the scan data and encourage organisations to patch. I realised in some recent incidents, impacted companies ran Pulse Secure VPN. I also realised through the vulnerability scanning which has been happening across the internet that many of the organisations either hadn't patched their Pulse Secure system at the time of the incident, or had only patched recently. In both cases the organisations had unpatched Pulse Secure systems, and the footprint was the same - access was gained to the network, domain admin was gained, VNC was used to move around the network, and then endpoint security tools were disabled and Sodinokibi was pushed to all systems via psexec. I've now seen an incident where they can prove Pulse Secure was used to gain access to the network.
