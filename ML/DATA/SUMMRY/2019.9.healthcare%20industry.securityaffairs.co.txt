Researchers at Greenbone Networks vulnerability analysis and management company discovered 400 Million medical radiological images exposed online via unsecured PACS servers. The experts at Greenbone Networks vulnerability analysis and management company discovered 600 unprotected servers exposed online that contained medical radiological images. PACS servers are used in the healthcare industry to archive images created by radiological processes and to make them available to medical staff for analysis and diagnosis. "There are more than 737 million images linked to this patient data, around 400 million of which are accessible or can be easily downloaded from the internet. In addition, there are 39 systems that allow access to patient data via an unencrypted HTTP Web Viewer, without any protection." The researchers used a RadiAnt DICOM Viewer to analyze data from open PACS servers exposed online, they were able to download and view 399.5 million images out of 733.5. Giving a look at the geographic distribution of the PACS servers that were leaking the images, most of unprotected PACS servers is in North America is in the U.S. "In the US, the number is orders of magnitude higher with 13.7 million data sets and 45.8 million images freely accessible on the internet." continues the report. In South America, most of the exposed images were stored on PACS servers in Brazil, in the country the experts found 640,000 data sets, and 31.1 million images.
