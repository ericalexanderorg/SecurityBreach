The Iranian state-backed threat actor tracked as APT42 is employing social engineering attacks, including posing as journalists, to breach corporate networks and cloud environments of Western and Middle Eastern targets. Google threat analysts following APT42's operations report that the hackers use malicious emails to infect their targets with two custom backdoors, namely "Nicecurl" and "Tamecat," which provide command execution and data exfiltration capabilities. Tamecat is a more complex PowerShell backdoor that can execute arbitrary PS code or C# scripts, giving APT42 much operational flexibility to perform data theft and extensive system manipulation. Similar, if not the same, malware was analyzed by Volexity in February, which also linked the attacks to Iranian threat actors. The full list of Indicators of Compromise for the recent APT42 campaign and YARA rules for detecting the NICECURL and TAMECAT malware can be found at the end of Google's report.
