South Africa's Postbank has suffered a major data breach, forcing the financial institution to replace 12 million bankcards after rogue employees stole its 36-digit master key. According to reports, in December 2018, the culprits covertly printed out the bank's master key in plain text, stealing approximately $3.35 million from beneficiaries who receive social grants every month. The attackers could have also accessed the bank's systems, editing account balances, and resetting or filling up Postbank cards. Between 8 million and 10 million cardholders were affected and, besides stealing funds from their accounts, the bad actors could have also exfiltrated the personal information of an additional 1 million customers. "The cost of replacing the affected cards is $58.7 million, and bank officials have yet to confirm if grant beneficiaries who were affected by the fraudulent acts will be reimbursed for their loses."It appears that the significance of magnitude of this card breach may have been comprehended by Postbank operations and IT senior management," former chief risk officer Benjamin April said in a January report. The Sassa master key compromise is a significant failure for the Postbank and also for the national payment system. In September 2019, South Africa's Reserve Bank provided an 18-month deadline for Postbank to replace the 12 million compromised cards.
