By directly communicating with the threat actor behind the massive data breach of cloud storage giant, Snowflake, we gained unprecedented insight into the devastating impact of Infostealer infections. Database samples provided by the threat actor led Hudson Rock researchers to believe that the data is genuine. Further explaining the source of the hack, the threat actor adds that all of these breaches stem from the hack of a single vendor - Snowflake. The goal of the threat actor, as in most cases, was to blackmail Snowflake into buying their own data back for $20,000,000. Further evidence of the hack includes a CSV file that the threat actor shared with Hudson Rock's researchers, which shows the depth of their access to Snowflake servers. Going over the data found in the CSV file, Hudson Rock researchers identified a Snowflake employee who was infected by a Lumma-type Infostealer on October 5th, 2023. When asked about the specific credentials used to carry out the hack, the threat actor confirmed to Hudson Rock researchers that indeed these are the same credentials they used, and shared a mutual sentiment with us around the absolute ease in which this gigantic hack could have been prevented.
