Over the New Year, Microsoft exposed nearly 250 million Customer Service and Support records on the web. The records contained logs of conversations between Microsoft support agents and customers from all over the world, spanning a 14-year period from 2005 to December 2019. Diachenko immediately notified Microsoft upon discovering the exposed data, and Microsoft took swift action to secure it. In total, the data was exposed for about two days before we alerted Microsoft and the records were secured. Tech support scams entail a scammer contacting users and pretending to be a Microsoft support representative. Remember that Microsoft never proactively reaches out to users to solve their tech problems-users must approach Microsoft for help first. Between January and March 2019, hackers compromised the account of a Microsoft support agent.
