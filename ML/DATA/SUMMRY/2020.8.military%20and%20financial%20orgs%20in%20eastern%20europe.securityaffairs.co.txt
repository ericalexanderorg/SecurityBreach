China-linked threat actor tracked as CactusPete was employing an updated backdoor in recent attacks targeting military and financial organizations in Eastern Europe. A China-linked APT group, tracked by Kaspersky as CactusPete, was observed using an updated backdoor in recent attacks targeting military and financial organizations in Eastern Europe. The CactusPete cyber-espionage group has been active since at least 2013, it has been mainly focused on military, diplomatic, and infrastructure targets in Asia and Eastern Europe. Since the end of February 2020, the group has been observed employing a new variant of its Bisonal backdoor to target organizations in the military and financial sectors in Eastern Europe. Upon execution, the malware used by the CactusPete first connects to the attackers' server, then sends information on the victim network, including hostname, IP and MAC address; OS version; infected host time; proxy usage flags, information on whether it was executed in a VMware environment; and system default CodePage Identifier. "Since the malware contains mostly information gathering functionality, most likely they hack into organizations to gain access to the victims' sensitive data. If we recall that CactusPete targets military, diplomatic and infrastructure organizations, the information could be very sensitive indeed," Kaspersky continues. "We call CatusPete an Advanced Persistent Threat group, but the Bisonal code we analyzed is not that advanced. Yet, interestingly, the CactusPete APT group has had success without advanced techniques, using plain code without complicated obfuscation and spear-phishing messages with 'magic' attachments as the preferred method of distribution," Kaspersky concludes.
