A North Korean hacking group stole secrets about satellites and warplanes from Nasa, US air bases and defence contractors, the FBI has revealed, as it launched a hunt to catch the perpetrators. The US government is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to the identity of hackers targeting American national security assets, including nuclear secrets and information about missiles, submarines and drones. On Thursday, the US and UK published joint guidance for facilities that could be attacked by Andariel, a "Malicious cyber group" controlled by North Korea's military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The US State Department said a North Korean national named Rim Jong Hyok was linked to the group, and had hacked into US hospitals and other healthcare providers to extort ransoms to fund its cyber attacks. "While North Korea uses these types of cyber crimes to circumvent international sanctions and fund its political and military ambitions, the impact of these wanton acts have a direct impact on the citizens of Kansas," said Stephen Cyrus, an FBI agent based in Kansas City. A briefing note released by the FBI and NCSC on Thursday said the North Korean hackers were based in Pyongyang and Sinuijuhad, and gained access to computer systems owned by defence contractors and healthcare providers by exploiting known vulnerabilities in software used by the companies. The hackers have tried to steal secrets linked to fighter aircraft, missiles, satellites, shipbuilding, uranium enrichment and nuclear power plants.
