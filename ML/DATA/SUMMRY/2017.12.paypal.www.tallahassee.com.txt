A PayPal owned company that processes utility payments for the City of Tallahassee notified about 8,000 customers who used remote location kiosks to pay their bills that a data breach may have compromised their personal and financial information. About 1.6 million utility customers nationwide who use the network were potentially affected by the breach. TIO PayPal notified the City Treasurer-Clerk's Revenue Division on Nov. 10 that TIO services were suspended until further notice because of a potential security breach of its nationwide network. Two days later, Nikolov explained in a follow-up email that PayPal had discovered network security vulnerabilities on the TIO platform and issues with TIO's data security program that did not adhere to PayPal's information security standards. The city posted a notice on its website in November about the suspension of the kiosk payment service and instructed customers to use alternate payment methods. TIO has operated kiosks at more than 40 locations in Tallahassee since 2008.TIO Networks USA President John Kunze followed up with letters dated Dec. 20 sent to customers notifying them "With an abundance of caution" that the investigation had uncovered unauthorized access to its network, and to personal information of customers of TIO's clients. "The PayPal platform, which is separate from the TIO network, is not impacted by this situation in any way and PayPal's customers' data remains secure."City Treasurer Jim Cooke said the vast majority of Tallahassee electric utility's 100,000-plus customers are not affected.
