Payment card processing giant TSYS suffered a ransomware attack earlier this month. The company says the malware did not jeopardize card data, and that the incident was limited to administrative areas of its business. TSYS provides payment processing services, merchant services and other payment solutions, including prepaid debit cards and payroll cards. The gang claims the data published so far represents just 15 percent of the information it offloaded from TSYS before detonating its ransomware inside the company. In a written response to requests for comment, TSYS said the attack did not affect systems that handle payment card processing. "We experienced a ransomware attack involving systems that support certain corporate back office functions of a legacy TSYS merchant business," TSYS said. According to Conti, the "Legacy" TSYS business unit hit was Cayan, an entity acquired by TSYS in 2018 that enables payments in physical stores and mobile locations, as well as e-commerce.
