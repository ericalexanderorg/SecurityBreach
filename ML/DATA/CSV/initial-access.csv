ATT&CK:T1078,"A hacker has been able to send messages via text, email, and landline to tens of thousands of people across Australia after an emergency warning alert service, used by councils, was hacked. The message sent from the Early Warning Network on Friday night warned ""EWN has been hacked. Your personal data is not safe. Trying to fix the security issues"". EWN said a hacker accessed its alerting system and sent the message to part of its database. ""EWN staff at the time were able to quickly identify the attack and shut off our systems limiting the amount of messages sent out. Unfortunately, a small proportion of our database received this alert."" ""The actual data held in our system is just 'white pages' type data, we deliberately don't hold any other personal information."" The company said it's warning system remained fully operational during the breach and that it was working with the Queensland Police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre on the investigation. Mr Plowright said in the case of the NT, the EWN would usually be responsible for providing data to a number of ""Blue chip"" clients, including councils, regarding when and how a cyclone could hit."
ATT&CK:T1078,"The Indiana Department of Insurance is investigating a recent data breach suffered by Bankers Life and Casualty Co., a division of Carmel-based insurance holding company CNO Financial Group Inc. Bankers Life and Casualty Co. disclosed late last week that it was hit by a data breach between May 30 and Sept. 13, and the hackers were able to gain extensive personal information for a ""Limited group"" of customers. Chicago-based Bankers Life sells financial products to middle-income clients, including Medicare supplement insurance, supplemental health insurance, life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuities. Bankers Life declined to disclose to IBJ details of how the outsiders gained access to employee information, nor would it disclose the number of customers whose personal information was accessed. In a statement released late last week, Bankers Life said that ""Unauthorized third parties"" gained access to a limited number of Bankers Life employees' credentials between May 30 and Sept. 13. In addition to the group whose data was accessed, Bankers Life said, a larger group of its customers may have had their information exposed; including names, addresses, birth dates, the last four digits of Social Security numbers and insurance information such as policy numbers, types of insurance, premiums, dates of service and claims amounts. On Thursday, the company said, it notified certain customers about the issue, including people who hold Medicare supplement policies through Colonial Penn Life Insurance Co., another CNO Financial unit. The Indiana Department of Insurance said consumers concerned about cybersecurity can get more information here."

ATT&CK:T1326,"Unknown hackers have hijacked the DNS server for BlackWallet. The attack happened late Saturday afternoon, January 13, when the attackers hijacked the DNS entry of the BlackWallet. ""The DNS hijack of Blackwallet injected code,"" said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who analyzed the code before the BlackWallet team regained access over their domain and took down the site. The BlackWallet team and other XLM owners have tried to warn users via alerts on Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, the Stellar Community and GalacticTalk forums, but to no avail, as users continued to log into the rogue BlackWallet. BlackWallet admins are now desperately trying to catch Bittrex's attention to block the hackers' account. According to the BlackWallet admin, the incident took place after someone accessed his hosting provider account. ""Please note however that blackwallet was only an account viewer and that no keys were stored on the server!""."
OWASP:A5,"Blind said that the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to ""a single server, one among many servers on our platform,"" according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email. Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members, but not the associated email addresses of each user. Blind claims on its website that its email verification ""Is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process."" It adds: ""This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can't do it."" Blind claims that the database ""Does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames,"" but we found did find streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. When other records didn't store an email address, the record contained the user's email as an unrecognized encrypted hash - which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else. Despite the company's apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens - the same kind of tokens that recently put Microsoft and Facebook accounts at risk. Some users sent anonymous, private messages in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails."

Bulletproof 360 Inc., purveyors of the fatty coffee touted as a wonder-treatment for mental clarity and weight loss, admitted that from May 20 to October 19 of this year - minus one day on October 14 - hackers slurped sensitive personal information hipsters entered when purchasing stuff online. ""In mid-October 2017, Bulletproof identified unauthorized computer code that had been added to the software that operates the checkout page at www.bulletproof.com,"" Bulletproof said in its mea culpa notification letter [PDF] to customers. Bulletproof said it is ""Working diligently"" to shore up its web systems after its security went to pot, and has vowed to prevent future similar attacks. As is usually the case with these sort of cockups, Bulletproof is advising its caffeine addicts to keep a close eye on their bank statements for any unauthorized charges brewing. The network security breach is particularly grinding for Bulletproof given its tech pedigree and the firm's particular appeal in Silicon Valley. Bulletproof got into the public spotlight on the back of endorsements from VC and startup execs in the tech world."
ATT&CK:T1078,"According to a letter of warning sent out recently the Orange County, Calif., branch of the Girl Scouts experienced a data breach. The data breach, which is estimated to affect almost 3,000 members, occurred over the course of one day toward the end of September. An unknown third-party attacker was able to gain access to the email , which then allowed them to send numerous emails to various strategic locations. The data contained within these records include full legal birth names, home addresses, driver's license numbers, health history, and even insurance policy numbers. In the aftermath of the breach, the Girl Scouts of Orange County notified the attorney general in California of the incident. The letter also stated that the Girl Scouts went through their emails and deleted any that contained personal data. Finally, Christina Salcido stated that the Girl Scouts are beefing up their security by ""Implementing a secure online system for Troop Travel forms,"" as well as other undisclosed security hardening efforts being developed with their IT team."
OWASP:A9,"Britain's data privacy watchdog has imposed one of its largest fines ever against retailer Carphone Warehouse over a massive data breach it suffered in 2015. The data breach of Carphone Warehouse affected its online division, which operates the OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk websites, and resulted in unauthorized access to the personal data of 3.3 million customers and 1,000 employees. ""A company as large, well-resourced and established as Carphone Warehouse should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks,"" U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham says. Because the ICO offers a 20 percent discount on fines that are paid within one month, it's expected that Carphone Warehouse will ultimately pay &pound320,000. While the ICO's breach report says there was ""No single root cause"" of the attack, it appeared to involve compromising a vulnerable WordPress installation that ""Was considerably out-of-date, exposed to the internet and suffered from multiple vulnerabilities."" Via WordPress, the attacker uploaded web shells that gave them file management and database access rights, the ICO says, at which point the attacker recovered credentials being stored in plaintext that led to the attacker accessing the databases that exposed customer data. The size of the fine against Carphone Warehouse equals the ICO's record fine for London-based telecommunications giant TalkTalk in October 2015. The Carphone Warehouse penalty comes just months before the EU begins enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation on May 25, 2018."

Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes for the Western District of Washington and Special Agent in Charge Jay S. Tabb Jr. of the FBI Seattle Field Office. According to three federal indictments unsealed today, Ukrainian nationals Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33, and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are members of a prolific hacking group widely known as FIN7. Since at least 2015, FIN7 members engaged in a highly sophisticated malware campaign targeting more than 100 U.S. companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. As set forth in indictments, FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers, which the group used or sold for profit. In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of companies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 15 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations. Each of the three FIN7 conspirators is charged with 26 felony counts alleging conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Hladyr allegedly served as FIN7's systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme."

OWASP:A5,"You've probably never heard of the marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis. Earlier this month, security researcher Vinny Troia discovered that Exactis, a data broker based in Palm Coast, Florida, had exposed a database that contained close to 340 million individual records on a publicly accessible server. The haul comprises close to 2 terabytes of data that appears to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults, as well as millions of businesses. While the precise number of individuals included in the data isn't clear-and the leak doesn't seem to contain credit card information or Social Security numbers-it does go into minute detail for each individual listed, including phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and other highly personal characteristics for every name. Exactis did not respond to multiple calls and emails from WIRED asking for comment on its data leak. Aside from the sheer breadth of the Exactis leak, it may be even more remarkable for its depth: Each record contains entries that go far beyond contact information and public records to include more than 400 variables on a vast range of specific characteristics: whether the person smokes, their religion, whether they have dogs or cats, and interests as varied as scuba diving and plus-size apparel. While the lack of financial information or Social Security numbers means the database isn't a straightforward tool for identity theft, the depth of personal info nonetheless could help scammers with other forms of social engineering, says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center."

OWASP:A10,"Malware capable of secretly recording payment card details was removed today from the Infowars online store after ZDNet reached out to the company's staff. The malware works by recording payment card details entered inside store checkout forms and then sending the data to remote servers. De Groot spotted the malware infection on the Infowars online store using a powerful malware scanner that he built a few years back and which is specialized in detecting vulnerabilities and infections in online stores built on top of the Magento e-commerce platform. This piece of code -also referred to as a card skimmer, or skimmer- was present on all Infowars store pages, but it only activated during the checkout process. The report, summarized in this ZDNet piece, presented the tactics and histories of seven different cyber-criminal operations that have deployed Magecart-like card skimming malware on online stores in the past four years. Albeit the Dutch researcher shared technical details on how the Infowars store was infected with the card skimmer, ZDNet will refrain from publishing such information to avoid putting future Infowars customers at unnecessary risk. Just yesterday, de Groot published research revealing that one in five online stores that suffered a Magecart infection were reinfected, at least once."

The server contained 21,612 records and climbing - representing weeks' worth of data, Diachenko told TechCrunch, prior to blogging his findings. The data included donor email addresses and donation receipts, which included customized links to a donor's tax receipt. It took Kars4Kids two days to pull the database offline after Diachenko warned of the data exposure, he said. Diachenko said that Kars4Kids had told him that customers had been informed, but TechCrunch has found no evidence of the company's claim.

OWASP:A10,"Kitronik says a recent data breach impacting online shoppers and involving the potential theft of their financial data is the work of Magecart. The company says that Magecart's payment card-skimming malware was operating on the Kitronik website over the period of August to September, as reported by the Register. Customers of the BBC micro:bit vendor and electronics kit seller may have been impacted by the breach. In an email to customers, Kitronik co-founder Geoff Hampson said that the firm believes ""Only details entered at the checkout stage that might have been taken and as a result, customers that had set up an account prior to August would not have had their address details stolen."" Kitronik has pointed the finger at Magecart for the data breach. Magecart has been connected to attacks which directly inject JavaScript into vulnerable e-commerce platforms in order to embed malware, as well as the compromise of payment systems through third-party applications and widgets. In October, a security researcher uncovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Magento extensions which are being actively abused by Magecart to spread payment-skimming malware."

ATT&CK:T1078,"The Justice Department has indicted two Iranian men behind the SamSam ransomware attacks - that infected the cities of Atlanta, San Diego and Newark, N.J. - as well as two others who converted the ransom into Iranian riyals. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, ""Extorted victims by leaving a ransom note in the form of a file on each computer encrypted by SamSam Ransomware,"" read the indictment, unsealed Wednesday a U.S. District Court in New Jersey. A SamSam attack crippled a number of systems and services in Atlanta in March and the Port of San Diego in September. The focus on healthcare may be due to the attacker's impression that these will be easier targets, they cybergang behind SamSam does show a preference for easy hits, or that they are more likely to fork over the ransom. Grammatical errors were a clue that the attackers likely didn't speak English as a first language, the attacks didn't rely on the typical badly worded spam email with an attachment. Once the attackers received the ransom, two Bitcoin exchangers, identified by the Treasury Department as Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, turned it into Iranian riyals. ""Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims. As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes,"" Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said in the release."
ATT&CK:T1193,"A summary obtained by Hard Fork details 14 different attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges since January last year and calculates the state-sponsored Lazarus group is responsible for $571 million of the ill-gotten gains. Group-IB expects the number of targeted attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges to rise, and not just the ones from Lazarus. It warns the most aggressive hacker groups, usually known for attacking banks, will shift their attention to cryptocurrency exchanges now they know just how lucrative it can be. Fraudsters are even building fake websites using stolen cryptocurrency project descriptions and plagiarized whitepapers, disappearing with investor funds shortly after launching a fake ICO. 51-percent attacks are increasing. Group-IB predict attacks on ICOs will remain a threat for almost every project looking to attract investors. For 51-percent attacks to be successful, bad actors must control a majority of the total computing power utilized by a Proof-of-Work powered blockchain. ""In 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million,"" Group-IB reports."
BGP Hijack,"Between 11am until 1pm UTC today, DNS traffic - the phone book of the internet, routing you to your favourite websites - was hijacked by an unknown actor. The attackers used BGP - a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world - to reroute traffic to Amazon's Route 53 service, the largest commercial cloud provider who count major websites such as Twitter.com as customers. So far the only known website to have traffic redirected was to MyEtherWallet.com, a cryptocurrency website. The attacks only gained a relatively small amount of currency from MyEtherWallet.com - however their wallets in total already contained over £20m of currency. Mounting an attack of this scale requires access to BGP routers at major ISPs and real computing resource to deal with so much DNS traffic. The attackers failed to obtain an SSL certificate while man-in-the-middle attacking the traffic - a very easy process - which alerted people to the issue at scale. The security vulnerabilities in BGP and DNS are well known, and have been attacked before."
OWASP:A10,"Hackers injected 15 lines of card skimming code on the online retailer's payments page which remained for more than a month between August 14 and September 18, Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at RiskIQ, told TechCrunch. The code siphoned off credit card data from unsuspecting customers to a server controlled by the hackers with a similar domain name - likely to avoid detection. In an email to customers, Newegg chief executive Danny Lee said the company has ""Not yet determined which customer accounts may have been affected."" When reached, a Newegg spokesperson did not immediately comment. Klijnsma called the incident ""Another well-disguised attack"" that looked near-identical to the recent British Airways credit card breach, and earlier, the Ticketmaster breach. Like that breach, RiskIQ attributed the Newegg credit card theft to the Magecart group, a collective of hackers that carry out targeted attacks against vulnerable websites. ""The breach of Newegg shows the true extent of Magecart operators' reach,"" said Klijnsma. Anyone who entered their credit card data during the period should immediately contact their banks."

The data available in plain text from Panera's site appeared to include records for any customer who has signed up for an account to order food online via panerabread.com. KrebsOnSecurity learned about the breach earlier today after being contacted by security researcher Dylan Houlihan, who said he initially notified Panera about customer data leaking from its Web site back on August 2, 2017. Some of the customer records include unique identifiers that increment by one for each new record, making it potentially simple for someone to scrape all available customer accounts. Another data point exposed in these records included the customer's Panera loyalty card number, which could potentially be abused by scammers to spend prepaid accounts or to otherwise siphon value from Panera customer loyalty accounts. It is not clear yet exactly how many Panera customer records may have been exposed by the company's leaky Web site, but incremental customer numbers indexed by the site suggest that number may be higher than seven million. Update, 8:40 p.m. ET: Almost minutes after this story was published, Panera gave a statement to Fox News downplaying the severity of this breach, stating that only 10,000 customer records were exposed."

OWASP:A5,"As ElasticSearch based leaks become the latest source of massive data exposures, Sky Brasil, one of the biggest subscription television services in Brazil, is the latest to leave its customers exposed after not securing the server with a password. Independent researcher Fabio Castro found the firm exposed the data of 32 million subscribers in 28.7GB of log files and a 429.1GB of API data that revealed names, home addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, client IP address, payment methods, and encrypted passwords. ""The data the server stored was Full name, e-mail, password, pay-TV package data, client ip addresses, personal addresses, payment methods,"" Castro told BleepingComputer. NuData Security Vice President Ryan Wilk said the year has been a particularly bad year for news of the ""Non-breach 'breach'"" of sensitive user PII data. ""The unfortunate mishandling of trusted data by Sky Brasil, and before that Deep Root, data.gov.uk, and WWE continues to show that sophisticated hacking is not required to obtain troves of identity data that can be used to create fraudulent identities or access online personas,"" Wilk said.

ATT&CK:T1193,"Hackers used phishing emails to break into a Virginia bank in two separate cyber intrusions over an eight-month period, making off with more than $2.4 million total. The email allowed the intruders to install malware on the victim's PC and to compromise a second computer at the bank that had access to the STAR Network, a system run by financial industry giant First Data that the bank uses to handle debit card transactions for customers. Just eight months later - in January 2017 according to the lawsuit - hackers broke in to the bank's systems once more, again gaining access to the financial institution's systems via a phishing email. Prior to executing the second heist, the hackers used the bank's Navigator system to fraudulently credit more than $2 million to various National Bank accounts. Verizon also told the bank that the malware the attackers used to gain their initial foothold at the bank in the 2017 breach was embedded in a booby-trapped Microsoft Word document. ""In its Coverage Determination, Everest further determined that the 2016 Intrusion and the 2017 Intrusion were a single event, and thus, pursuant to the Debit Card Rider, National Bank's total coverage under the Bond was $50,000.00 for both intrusions,"" the bank said in its lawsuit. On July 20 it filed a response to the bank's claims, alleging that National Bank has not accurately characterized the terms of its coverage or fully explained the basis for Everest's coverage decision."

OWASP:A5,"U.S. Postal Service just fixed a security weakness that allowed anyone who has an account at usps.com to view account details for some 60 million other users, and in some cases to modify account details on their behalf. In addition to exposing near real-time data about packages and mail being sent by USPS commercial customers, the flaw let any logged-in usps.com user query the system for account details belonging to any other users, such as email address, username, user ID, account number, street address, phone number, authorized users, mailing campaign data and other information. In cases where multiple accounts shared a common data element - such as a street address - using the API to search for one specific data element often brought up multiple records. ""It seems like the only access control they had in place was that you were logged in at all. And if you can access other peoples' data because they aren't enforcing access controls on reading that data, it's catastrophically bad and I'm willing to bet they're not enforcing controls on writing to that data as well."" The USPS appears to have included a validation step to prevent unauthorized changes - at least with some data fields. It does not appear USPS account passwords were exposed via this API, although KrebsOnSecurity conducted only a very brief and limited review of the API's rather broad functionality before reporting the issue to the USPS. The API at issue resides here; a copy of the API prior to its modification on Nov. 20 by the USPS is available here as a text file. The USPS told the OIG it had addressed the authentication problems raised in the audit report, which appear to have been related to how data was encrypted in transit."
OWASP:A10,"Vision Direct has admitted customers' personal and financial data was leaked earlier this month after hackers compromised the company's website. The breach took place between 00:11 GMT on 3 November and 12:52 GMT on 8 November, said Vision Direct, which purports to be Europe's largest etailer of contact lenses and eye care products and services. Customers who logged in during those times to update their accounts, or anyone creating a new account will have been affected and their data exposed, the company confirmed.

OWASP:A5,"The server wasn't protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew where to look to peek in and snoop on a near-real-time stream of text messages. Worse, the database - running on Amazon's Elasticsearch - was configured with a Kibana front-end, making the data within easily readable, browsable and searchable for names, cell numbers and the contents of the text messages themselves. It's firms like Voxox that act as a gateway and converting those codes into text messages, to be passed on to the cell networks for delivery to the user's phone. At the time of its closure, the database appeared to have a little over 26 million text messages year-to-date.

OWASP:A5,"The past few days have showered plenty of favorable attention on a new trading platform called DX.Exchange, with glowing profiles by Bloomberg News and CNBC. The only problem is that the site, which allows people to trade currencies and digitized versions of Apple, Tesla, and other stocks, has been leaking oodles of account login credentials and personal user information. Besides spilling user data and allowing unauthorized access to user accounts, the leak puts the entire security of the site in serious jeopardy because some of the leaked tokens appear to belong to employees of the site. In the event that such a token gave unauthorized access to an account with administrative privileges, the hacker might be able to download entire databases, seed the site with malware, and possibly even transfer funds out of user accounts. Ars sent emails to users of eight randomly chosen tokens to ask if they had accounts on the site. A few hours later, officials announced a site maintenance update, but even after the site came back online, the leak continued. The favorable attention showered on DX.Exchange is unfortunate, because it detracts attention from several security weaknesses that should serve as warning signs that the site may not be adequately safeguarding the tremendous amount of sensitive data it requires users to provide. Best practices call for authentication tokens to be time stamped and then signed with a private encryption key each time a user sends it to a site."
OWASP:A5,"An investigation is underway into a booking software vulnerability that exposed airline passenger name records, which is a bundle of personal and travel data that gets collected whenever someone books a flight. El Al uses a booking system from Amadeus, a Madrid-based company based that works with 500 airlines, including United Airlines and Air Canada. Airlines typically issue a six-digit alphanumeric booking reference code whenever someone books their ticket. El Al sends customers a link to a web page to check their PNR. But Rotem discovered that he could insert a random booking reference number into the link. With that information in hand, it's possible to access someone else's booking information using the booking reference number and the last name of a passenger. Global distribution systems, such as the one run by Amadeus and other booking software providers, including Sabre and Travelport, date back decades. ""The way 6-digit booking codes are chosen makes them weaker than a 5-digit password ("". In the short term, Nohl and Nikodijevic recommended airlines employ Captchas and also limit the number of requests per IP address."
BEC:Impersonation,"In a case of business email compromise, Chinese hackers stole $18.6 million from the Indian arm of Tecnimont SpA, an Italian engineering company, through an elaborate cyber fraud scheme that included impersonating the firm's chief executive, the Economic Times reports. The scammers sent emails requesting funds to the India head of Tecnimont, part of the publicly traded Maire Tecnimont, from an account that looked deceptively similar to one used by the Italian group's CEO, and also organized conference calls to discuss a ""Confidential"" acquisition in China, the ET report said. Defending against sophisticated BEC scams can be more difficult than spotting a phishing email, security experts note. According to the report in Economic Times, after sending emails to head of Indian subsidiary of the Milan-headquartered firm, hackers then arranged a series of conference calls to discuss a confidential acquisition in China. Tools such as DMARC, Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance, and SPF, Sender Policy Framework, only work when emails are sent from the same domain name. ""DMARC is a lot about business email compromise, spoofing of email etc, but it works only if hackers are spoofing on your domain. In such cases, SPF policies and DMARC will work and stop you from getting conned,"" says Shomiron Das Gupta, founder and CEO at Netmonastery, a SIEM security and event log management firm. In BEC attacks, the fake message often comes from a legitimate email account that an attacker has gained access to, either through social engineering or a targeted compromise."

OWASP:A1,"LONDON - A recent attack aimed at a U.S.-based oil, gas and chemical supplier leverages the company's use of the enterprise-class Asterisk open-source PBX software, used for VoIP services. According to research from Check Point, presented here at Virus Bulletin 2019 on Friday, the attack was first identified early last year when researchers spotted scanning activity targeting 1,500 unique gateways tied to 600 companies. As a result, the adversary was able to gain complete control over the server, including being able to access databases, call recordings, metadata and detailed information on who called whom and when within the organization. The attacker injected a call file that caused the Asterisk server to make external calls and play canned messages with the identity of the victimized company. The PHP code hooked up with a command-and-control server, and downloaded a password-protected PHP web shell that carried out the data extraction, including the CALL file, which contains metadata on the calls made by the server. The attacker inserted a new CALL file into the outgoing directory, offering the ability to make outgoing calls under the guise of the victimized company. ""The infection vector is a customized PHP web shell, which is weaponized with new techniques targeting the Asterisk internal configuration files and databases - the same databases that hold all of the calls' metadata as well as the recordings of the calls,"" according to the paper."

The database of more than 200 gigabytes - including two collections that had 199.1 million and 244.4 million email addresses and records respectively over a four-year period between 2013 and 2017. It's not the first time a massive database of email addresses has leaked online. An exposed database run by River City Media leaked over 393 million email addresses in 2017, which prompted a frivolous lawsuit against the security researcher who found it. Later in the year, a massive spambot of 711 million email addresses, believed to be largest ever, was uncovered last year by a Paris-based researcher."
OWASP:A5,"India's largest bank, the State Bank of India, has leaked the financial data of millions of its customers, according to a TechCrunch report. The bank, according to TechCrunch on Wednesday, left a server with the banking data of its customers unprotected. The reported server made sensitive data accessible for anyone to view, but the issue appears to have been fixed. The unprotected server was discovered at one of its data centres in Mumbai by a security researcher, who preferred to remain anonymous. The server, which stored two months of financial data from SBI Quick, is a text message and call-based system that allows customers to review their recent transactions, balances, and credit information. Just days earlier, SBI had accused Aadhaar's authority, Unique Identification Authority of India, of mishandling citizen data that allowed fake Aadhaar identity cards to be created. ""Speaking about this particular leak, I think virtually any large financial organisations may face a similar incident. Modern IT infrastructures are so complicated that virtually no single company has an up2date and holistic inventory of their digital assets, let alone continuous monitoring and related security processes. While data sharing with trusted third-parties makes privacy and data protection virtually impossible."""

When entrusting a software wallet with your assets, you are exposing your private keys to the internet, leaving them vulnerable to attack."" Coinomi has responded to the allegations in this post on Medium which states the spell checking functionality was enabled for desktop wallets but that the seed phrase wasn't sent as plain text, it was ""Encapsulated inside a HTTPS request with Google being the sole recipient."" It added that Google did not process, cache or store the requests. A report by security consultant Warith Al Maawali claims he lost $60,000 to $70,000 while using the Coinomi wallet. Al Maawali told Decrypt he used his Ethereum seed phrase in the Coinomi wallet to access Ethereum-based tokens that he owned but were not supported by the Exodus crypto wallet which he was already using. Due to this, he did some research and found what he believes is a critical vulnerability within the Coinomi wallet. There have been other reports of funds disappearing on the Coinomi wallet-which isn't uncommon for any software wallet. There are two posts on Reddit by users who claim their funds have disappeared from the Coinomi wallet."

Agora offers courses on child rights, humanitarian action, data, research and is used by UNICEF staff and members of the public. UNICEF became aware fi the incident a day after the email was sent and remedied the situation to ""Prevent such an incident from reoccurring"". Agora users were sent an email explaining the situation which then asked them to delete the spreadsheet full of data they may have received from their inboxes and their recycle bins too. Whether UNICEF will be subject to a GDPR investigation is undetermined as of yet, with some experts thinking that UNICEF may avoid one as it's a United Nations organisation. Clare Sullivan, managing director of CyberSMART told Devex that UNICEF will probably be exempt from a GDPR probe as a UN body but it's something that still hasn't been tested in court. Mekki took a more absolute approach when addressing the question and said: ""UN entities are not subject to GDPR"" and that UNICEF did not report the case to authorities."
OWASP:A5,"A Wisconsin mattress company leaked the records of 387,000 customers online in a database that lacked password protection, a security researcher has found. The incident once again demonstrates the potential security consequences of failing to take even the simplest security measures to protect company data. Further investigation found that every file contained references to Verlo Mattress Factory and ""Appeared to be customer data,"" he said in a blog post about the incident on Thursday. The database set-which contains 387,604 records with names, phone numbers, emails, home addresses and billing addresses-was open and visible in any browser for anyone to edit, download or even delete data without administrative credentials, according to Fowler. Data found in the files also included login credentials with hashed passwords for internal users as well as IP addresses, ports, pathways and storage info that could allow potential cybercriminals deeper access to other network resources, he said. The latter was the case earlier this month, when cosmetics giant Yves Rocher exposed the personal data of millions of its customers and reams of sensitive internal company information to the public because of an online server left unprotected by a third-party consultant to the firm. ""In today's world, it is not if a data breach will happen, it is a matter of when the data breach will happen,"" he wrote."
OWASP:A10,"Trend Micro researchers reported that a Magecart group has hacked the websites of two hotel chains to inject scripts targeting Android and iOS users. Researchers discovered a series of incidents involving software credit card skimmer used by Magecart to hit the booking websites of hotel chains. In early September, the researchers discovered a JavaScript code onto two hotel websites belonging to different hotel chains. ""The downloaded script for mobile devices is a credit card skimmer which can steal the information entered on the hotel booking page and send it to a remote server."" Experts noticed that the link would deliver a credit card skimmer script only when users visited the websites using mobile devices, suggesting that the attackers aimed at targeting only mobile users. Although the module was only used for two websites of two different hotel chains, the number of potential victims is very high, as one of these brands has 107 hotels in 14 countries, while the other has 73 hotels in 14 countries. The software skimmer replaces the original credit card form on the booking page, in this way attackers could require customers to submit all credit card data, including the CVC number that is not required in some booking pages."

OWASP:A5,"The breach, which reportedly exposed data on millions of passengers, is one of many that have resulted from organizations leaving data publicly accessible in cloud storage buckets. A breach that reportedly exposed data on millions of passengers of two Lion Air airline subsidiaries is another example of the massive exposure that organizations face from leaving data in poorly secured cloud storage. The data belonged to passengers of Malindo Air and Thai Lion Air. A Dark Web operator known as Spectre later dumped four files - two containing data from Malindo and two with data on Thai Lion Air - online, South China Morning Post reported this week. ""Our in house teams along with external data service providers, Amazon Web Services and GoQuo, our e-commerce partner, are currently investigating into this breach,"" Malindo Air said. In June, Australian cybersecurity vendor UpGuard reported on data integration firm Attunity's exposing a terabyte's worth of backups belonging to companies including Ford, Netflix, and TD Bank by putting the data in three publicly accessible S3 buckets.

OWASP:A5,"Exclusive Tesco has shuttered its parking validation web app after The Register uncovered tens of millions of unsecured ANPR images sitting in a Microsoft Azure blob. The images consisted of photos of cars taken as they entered and left 19 Tesco car parks spread across Britain. Tesco admitted to The Register that ""Tens of millions"" of timestamped images were stored on it, adding that the images had been left exposed after a data migration exercise. Tesco customers across the nation were instructed to use parkshopreg.co.uk to validate their parking with a code printed on their receipts along with their vehicle's registration number, thus avoiding parking charges. Live ANPR images were saved to the blob as timestamped jpegs with the time information also contained within the image filenames, allowing anyone with access to harvest the images in bulk for illicit use. The web app compared the store-generated code with the ANPR images to decide whom to issue with parking charges. A Tesco spokesman told The Register: ""A technical issue with a parking app meant that for a short period historic images and times of cars entering and exiting our car parks were accessible. Whilst no images of people, nor any sensitive data were available, any security breach is unacceptable and we have now disabled the app as we work with our service provider to ensure it doesn't happen again."""

The hacker, who goes by the name L&M, told Motherboard he hacked into more than 7,000 iTrack accounts and more than 20,000 ProTrack accounts, two apps that companies use to monitor and manage fleets of vehicles through GPS tracking devices. On some cars, the software has the capability of remotely turning off the engines of vehicles that are stopped or are traveling 12 miles per hour or slower, according to the manufacturer of certain GPS tracking devices. According to a sample of user data L&M shared with Motherboard, the hacker has scraped a treasure trove of information from ProTrack and iTrack customers, including: name and model of the GPS tracking devices they use, the devices' unique ID numbers; usernames, real names, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses. A screenshot of the hacked account of a user, provided to Motherboard by the hacker. Though the hacker didn't prove that he was able to turn off a car's engine, a representative for Concox, the makers of one of the hardware GPS tracking devices used by some of the users of ProTrack GPS and iTrack, confirmed to Motherboard that customers can turn off the engines remotely if the vehicles are going under 20 kilometers per hour.

On May 24, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that First American had just fixed a weakness in its Web site that exposed approximately 885 million documents - many of them with Social Security and bank account numbers - going back at least 16 years. On May 29, The New York Times reported that the inquiry by New York's Department of Financial Services is likely to be followed by other investigations from regulators and law enforcement. First American says it has hired a third-party security firm to investigate, and that it shut down external access to the records. The Times says few people outside the real estate industry are familiar with First American, but millions have entrusted their data to the company when they go to close the deal on buying or selling a new home. ""First American provides title insurance and settlement services for property sales, which typically require buyers to hand over extensive financial records to other parties in their transactions,"" wrote Stacy Cowley.

OWASP:A6,"A Florida-based ad agency has left a database open on the internet that leaked details about past advertising campaigns, including information regarding medical malpractice cases, and sensitive details about combat injuries sustained by US military veterans. The database, discovered by security researchers from vpnMentor, belonged to X Social Media, an ad company that runs Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns for the legal industry. Data contained in these forms usually included full names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, and details related to their cases - mostly focused on medical injuries. ""The injuries described in the database vary from combat injuries suffered by American veterans to injuries caused by medical devices, pesticide use, medication side-effects, and defective baby products,"" the vpnMentor said in a report published this week. The details about combat injuries not only included information such as the date and place where the injury occurred, but also detailed medical information and mental trauma the person suffered in the aftermath; details that many applications wouldn't want made public. On top of this highly sensitive information relating to various injuries and legal cases, the X Social Media database also contained information about all the company's clients, ad campaign metrics, and even all the company's invoices.

OWASP:A10,"Cybersecurity researchers have discovered over 80 Magecart compromised e-commerce websites that were actively sending credit card information of online shoppers to the attackers-controlled servers. Magecart is an umbrella term given to different cybercriminal groups that are specialized in secretly implanting online credit card skimmers on compromised e-commerce websites with an intent to steal payment card details of their customers. These virtual credit card skimmers, also known as formjacking attack, are basically JavaScript code that hackers secretly insert into a compromised website, often on the shopping cart page, designed to capture payment information of customers in real-time and send it to a remote attacker-controlled server. The newly disclosed campaign doesn't belong to a single group of Magecart hackers; instead, researchers used a source code search engine to search for obfuscated JavaScript on the Internet with malicious patterns that were previously seen in the Magecart's virtual credit card skimmers. According to the researchers, the technique allowed them to quickly uncover more than 80 e-commerce websites compromised by Magecart groups, most of which were found running over outdated versions of Magento CMS that's vulnerable to an unauthenticated upload and remote code execution vulnerabilities. ""Many of the compromised sites are running version 1.5, 1.7, or 1.9. The arbitrary file upload, remote code execution, and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities all affect Magento version 2.1.6 and below. While it can't be stated authoritatively that this is what led to the breach of these sites, these are vulnerable versions of Magento that allow adversaries to inject the formjacking code into the site."" Though the researchers have not named the compromised companies in its report, they worked with federal law enforcement to notify all affected organizations as well as off-site servers prior to publishing their report. ""To recruit merchandise mules, the attacker posts jobs that offer people the ability to work from home and earn large sums of money to receive and reship merchandise purchased with the stolen credit card numbers,"" the researchers say."

The forum administrators are also notifying affected users via email. As mentioned, XKCD uses phpBB, a free and open-source forum and bulletin board software built in the PHP programming software. At this moment it's unclear if XKCD was using an older version of the forum software vulnerable to a security flaw or the attackers exploited any previously undiscovered flaw in phpBB to extract the data unauthorisedly. Even if XKCD was running over phpBB version 3.1 and later, which uses more secure BCRYPT hashing algorithm, it's possible that the passwords for early users of the XKCD forum were encrypted via the older, less secure MD5 hashing method.

Phone numbers have not been public in more than a year since Facebook restricted access to users' phone numbers. TechCrunch verified a number of records in the database by matching a known Facebook user's phone number against their listed Facebook ID. We also checked other records by matching phone numbers against Facebook's own password reset feature, which can be used to partially reveal a user's phone number linked to their account. This latest incident exposed millions of users' phone numbers just from their Facebook IDs, putting them at risk of spam calls and SIM-swapping attacks, which relies on tricking cell carriers into giving a person's phone number to an attacker. Jain said he found profiles with phone numbers associated with several celebrities. Facebook spokesperson Jay Nancarrow said the data had been scraped before Facebook cut off access to user phone numbers. Facebook has long restricted developers access to user phone numbers."
ATT&CK:T1078,"Twitter today finally decided to temporarily disable a feature, called 'Tweeting via SMS,' after it was abused by a hacking group to compromise Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey last week and sent a series of racist and offensive tweets to Dorsey's followers. Dorsey's Twitter account was compromised last week when a hacker group calling itself ""Chuckling Squad"" replicated a mobile phone number associated with the CEO account and abused this particular feature to post racist, offensive messages and bomb threats from it via SMS. Replicating a mobile phone number associated with someone else is a technique known as ""SIM swapping,"" where attackers social engineer a victim's mobile phone provider and trick the telecom company to transfer target's phone number to their own SIM card. Once they social engineered an AT&T employee and gained access to Dorsey's phone number, the Chuckling Squad hackers used the 'Tweeting via SMS' feature to post tweets under his username, even without actually logging in to his account. For those unaware, Twitter has a feature that gives its users the ability to post a tweet from their account just by sending an SMS message to the company number from their registered mobile number associated with their Twitter account. Twitter says the phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider, allowing an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number pic. The feature still exists and has been misused several times in the past since no authentication is required other than just having access to the linked phone number. In a series of tweets published today, Twitter says it has temporarily disabled this feature and working on improving it by exploring options to offer an authenticated way."

The city of Columbia site had a security flaw in its search tool, according to independent security researcher Arif Khan. The flaw let anyone view passwords for the website's database and email protocol servers, creating a massive potential for abuse, Khan said on Thursday. The vulnerability made it possible for someone to ""Pull sensitive data out of the Columbia city government's database,"" Khan said. With access to the email protocol servers, an attacker could've also created spoof emails that looked like they'd come from the city government. He reached out again in October, he said, and another security researcher also publicly contacted the city government in November on Twitter. Cybercriminals often target city governments because they serve an important function and have access to sensitive information."
