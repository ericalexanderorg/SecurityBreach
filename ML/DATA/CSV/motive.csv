Hacktivism:Schadenfreude,"A hacker has been able to send messages via text, email, and landline to tens of thousands of people across Australia after an emergency warning alert service, used by councils, was hacked. The message sent from the Early Warning Network on Friday night warned ""EWN has been hacked. Your personal data is not safe. Trying to fix the security issues"". EWN said a hacker accessed its alerting system and sent the message to part of its database. ""EWN staff at the time were able to quickly identify the attack and shut off our systems limiting the amount of messages sent out. Unfortunately, a small proportion of our database received this alert."" ""The actual data held in our system is just 'white pages' type data, we deliberately don't hold any other personal information."" The company said it's warning system remained fully operational during the breach and that it was working with the Queensland Police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre on the investigation. Mr Plowright said in the case of the NT, the EWN would usually be responsible for providing data to a number of ""Blue chip"" clients, including councils, regarding when and how a cyclone could hit."
PII:?,"The Indiana Department of Insurance is investigating a recent data breach suffered by Bankers Life and Casualty Co., a division of Carmel-based insurance holding company CNO Financial Group Inc. Bankers Life and Casualty Co. disclosed late last week that it was hit by a data breach between May 30 and Sept. 13, and the hackers were able to gain extensive personal information for a ""Limited group"" of customers. Chicago-based Bankers Life sells financial products to middle-income clients, including Medicare supplement insurance, supplemental health insurance, life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuities. Bankers Life declined to disclose to IBJ details of how the outsiders gained access to employee information, nor would it disclose the number of customers whose personal information was accessed. In a statement released late last week, Bankers Life said that ""Unauthorized third parties"" gained access to a limited number of Bankers Life employees' credentials between May 30 and Sept. 13. In addition to the group whose data was accessed, Bankers Life said, a larger group of its customers may have had their information exposed; including names, addresses, birth dates, the last four digits of Social Security numbers and insurance information such as policy numbers, types of insurance, premiums, dates of service and claims amounts. On Thursday, the company said, it notified certain customers about the issue, including people who hold Medicare supplement policies through Colonial Penn Life Insurance Co., another CNO Financial unit. The Indiana Department of Insurance said consumers concerned about cybersecurity can get more information here."

Money:Cryptocurrency,"Unknown hackers have hijacked the DNS server for BlackWallet. The attack happened late Saturday afternoon, January 13, when the attackers hijacked the DNS entry of the BlackWallet. ""The DNS hijack of Blackwallet injected code,"" said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who analyzed the code before the BlackWallet team regained access over their domain and took down the site. The BlackWallet team and other XLM owners have tried to warn users via alerts on Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, the Stellar Community and GalacticTalk forums, but to no avail, as users continued to log into the rogue BlackWallet. BlackWallet admins are now desperately trying to catch Bittrex's attention to block the hackers' account. According to the BlackWallet admin, the incident took place after someone accessed his hosting provider account. ""Please note however that blackwallet was only an account viewer and that no keys were stored on the server!""."
Hacktivism:Schadenfreude,"Blind said that the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to ""a single server, one among many servers on our platform,"" according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email. Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members, but not the associated email addresses of each user. Blind claims on its website that its email verification ""Is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process."" It adds: ""This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can't do it."" Blind claims that the database ""Does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames,"" but we found did find streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. When other records didn't store an email address, the record contained the user's email as an unrecognized encrypted hash - which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else. Despite the company's apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens - the same kind of tokens that recently put Microsoft and Facebook accounts at risk. Some users sent anonymous, private messages in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails."

Bulletproof 360 Inc., purveyors of the fatty coffee touted as a wonder-treatment for mental clarity and weight loss, admitted that from May 20 to October 19 of this year - minus one day on October 14 - hackers slurped sensitive personal information hipsters entered when purchasing stuff online. ""In mid-October 2017, Bulletproof identified unauthorized computer code that had been added to the software that operates the checkout page at www.bulletproof.com,"" Bulletproof said in its mea culpa notification letter [PDF] to customers. Bulletproof said it is ""Working diligently"" to shore up its web systems after its security went to pot, and has vowed to prevent future similar attacks. As is usually the case with these sort of cockups, Bulletproof is advising its caffeine addicts to keep a close eye on their bank statements for any unauthorized charges brewing. The network security breach is particularly grinding for Bulletproof given its tech pedigree and the firm's particular appeal in Silicon Valley. Bulletproof got into the public spotlight on the back of endorsements from VC and startup execs in the tech world."
PII:?,"According to a letter of warning sent out recently the Orange County, Calif., branch of the Girl Scouts experienced a data breach. The data breach, which is estimated to affect almost 3,000 members, occurred over the course of one day toward the end of September. An unknown third-party attacker was able to gain access to the email , which then allowed them to send numerous emails to various strategic locations. The data contained within these records include full legal birth names, home addresses, driver's license numbers, health history, and even insurance policy numbers. In the aftermath of the breach, the Girl Scouts of Orange County notified the attorney general in California of the incident. The letter also stated that the Girl Scouts went through their emails and deleted any that contained personal data. Finally, Christina Salcido stated that the Girl Scouts are beefing up their security by ""Implementing a secure online system for Troop Travel forms,"" as well as other undisclosed security hardening efforts being developed with their IT team."
PII:?,"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield on Wednesday said it had been hit with a data breach that compromised the personal information on approximately 1.1 million customers. As I noted in this Feb. 9, 2015 story, Anthem was breached not long after a malware campaign was erected that mimicked Anthem's domain names at the time of the breach. On Feb. 27, 2015, ThreatConnect published more information tying the same threat actors and modus operandi to a domain called ""Prennera[dot]com"". ""It is believed that the prennera[dot]com domain may have been impersonating the Healthcare provider Premera Blue Cross, where the attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the 'm' with two 'n' characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would be seen five months later with the we11point[dot]com command and control infrastructure,"" ThreatConnect observed in a February 2015 blog post. Turns out, the same bulk registrant in China that registered the phony Premera and Anthem domains in April 2014 also registered two Carefirst look-alike domains - careflrst[dot]com and caref1rst[dot]com. ThreatConnect has unearthed evidence showing the same tactics were used on EmpireB1ue.com, a domain registered April 11, 2014. EmpireBlue BlueCross BlueShield was one of the organizations impacted by the Anthem breach."
Money:Credit Card,"US coffee store chain Caribou Coffee announced a security breach today after it discovered unauthorized access of its point of sale systems. All customers who used a credit or debit card at one of the affected stores between August 28, 2018, and December 3, 2018, should consider their card details compromised and take precautions such as asking for a card replacement, reviewing credit card reports, and enrolling in identity protection programs. Users can consult the list of impacted stores via the company's data breach notice, posted on its homepage. Caribou Coffee officials said they detected that something was wrong last month, on November 28, when its IT staff was alerted of ""Unusual activity"" on its network via its security monitoring processes. Two days later, Mandiant informed Caribou Coffee that it discovered unauthorized access of the company's POS system that also exposed some of the coffee store's customer data. Caribou Coffee said that names, card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes might have been exposed and collected by intruders. ""At this time, we are confident that the breach has been contained,"" said Caribou Coffee officials."
PII:?,"Britain's data privacy watchdog has imposed one of its largest fines ever against retailer Carphone Warehouse over a massive data breach it suffered in 2015. The data breach of Carphone Warehouse affected its online division, which operates the OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk websites, and resulted in unauthorized access to the personal data of 3.3 million customers and 1,000 employees. ""A company as large, well-resourced and established as Carphone Warehouse should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks,"" U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham says. Because the ICO offers a 20 percent discount on fines that are paid within one month, it's expected that Carphone Warehouse will ultimately pay &pound320,000. While the ICO's breach report says there was ""No single root cause"" of the attack, it appeared to involve compromising a vulnerable WordPress installation that ""Was considerably out-of-date, exposed to the internet and suffered from multiple vulnerabilities."" Via WordPress, the attacker uploaded web shells that gave them file management and database access rights, the ICO says, at which point the attacker recovered credentials being stored in plaintext that led to the attacker accessing the databases that exposed customer data. The size of the fine against Carphone Warehouse equals the ICO's record fine for London-based telecommunications giant TalkTalk in October 2015. The Carphone Warehouse penalty comes just months before the EU begins enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation on May 25, 2018."
PII:?,"The breach involved private user information, including phone numbers, dates of birth, frequent flier membership numbers and passport and government ID numbers, as well as information on passengers' past travels. The airline said that 27 credit card numbers - but not their corresponding security codes - had been obtained, as had 403 expired credit card numbers. The company said that no passwords were compromised, and that the breach would not affect flight operations or safety. The security breach has come at a tough time for the company, which counts the state-backed carrier Air China as a major shareholder. In an era when issues of data protection have come to the fore in Washington and other global capitals, the Cathay breach does not stand out for its scale. The airline said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that around 860,000 passport numbers and 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers had been exposed. Delta Air Lines said earlier this year that customer payment information had been exposed after a security breach at a company that provided online chat services for it."

Money:Credit Card,"Three high-ranking members of a sophisticated international cybercrime group operating out of Eastern Europe have been arrested and are currently in custody facing charges filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes for the Western District of Washington and Special Agent in Charge Jay S. Tabb Jr. of the FBI Seattle Field Office. According to three federal indictments unsealed today, Ukrainian nationals Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33, and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are members of a prolific hacking group widely known as FIN7. Since at least 2015, FIN7 members engaged in a highly sophisticated malware campaign targeting more than 100 U.S. companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. As set forth in indictments, FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers, which the group used or sold for profit. In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of companies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 15 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations. Each of the three FIN7 conspirators is charged with 26 felony counts alleging conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Hladyr allegedly served as FIN7's systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme."

Money:Cryptocurrency,"UPDATE: Coincheck has detailed its compensation policy for customers whose XEM was stolen. To recap: Coincheck confirmed Friday that the hack, now likely the largest ever in the space, occurred on its servers early afternoon local time in Tokyo. Neither Coincheck nor XEM are as systemically important as Gox and bitcoin were four years ago. Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, calculated that the Mt. Gox hack represented roughly 5 percent of all crypto assets' aggregate network value at the time. In contrast, the Coincheck theft represents less than 0.25 percent of the aggregate value, meaning ""The impact of the Mt. Gox hack was more than an order of magnitude greater on the crypto markets at the time,"" he said. Another difference is that the Coincheck customers have some hope of being repaid, whereas most of the bitcoins stolen from Gox were never recovered and its users were not made whole. During a press conference Friday, Coincheck executives indicated customers would be compensated for their stolen crypto, though it is unclear at this time whether they would be fully reimbursed."
PII:?,"Cloud-based human resources company ComplyRight said this week that a security breach of its Web site may have jeopardized sensitive consumer information - including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and Social Security numbers - from tax forms submitted by the company's thousands of clients on behalf of employees. Pompano Beach, Fla-based ComplyRight began mailing breach notification letters to affected consumers late last week, but the form letters are extremely vague about the scope and cause of the breach. On Wednesday evening, ComplyRight posted additional facts about the incident on its site, saying a recently completed investigation suggests that fewer than 10 percent of individuals with tax forms prepared on the ComplyRight platform were impacted. ComplyRight includes information about its tax solutions division here and it appears that they also file Affordable Care Act and HIPAA paperwork. Again, neither ComplyRight nor its parent firm responded to multiple requests for comment. People who received a letter from ComplyRight may also file a Form 14039 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to help reduce the likelihood of becoming victims of tax refund fraud, an increasingly common scam in which fraudsters file a tax refund request with the IRS in your name and then pocket the refund money. Update, July 23, 8:00 a.m. ET: In a breach notice sent to Wisconsin's department of consumer protection, ComplyRight said its data breach affected 662,000 people."

Hacktivism:Press,"You've probably never heard of the marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis. Earlier this month, security researcher Vinny Troia discovered that Exactis, a data broker based in Palm Coast, Florida, had exposed a database that contained close to 340 million individual records on a publicly accessible server. The haul comprises close to 2 terabytes of data that appears to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults, as well as millions of businesses. While the precise number of individuals included in the data isn't clear-and the leak doesn't seem to contain credit card information or Social Security numbers-it does go into minute detail for each individual listed, including phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and other highly personal characteristics for every name. Exactis did not respond to multiple calls and emails from WIRED asking for comment on its data leak. Aside from the sheer breadth of the Exactis leak, it may be even more remarkable for its depth: Each record contains entries that go far beyond contact information and public records to include more than 400 variables on a vast range of specific characteristics: whether the person smokes, their religion, whether they have dogs or cats, and interests as varied as scuba diving and plus-size apparel. While the lack of financial information or Social Security numbers means the database isn't a straightforward tool for identity theft, the depth of personal info nonetheless could help scammers with other forms of social engineering, says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center."

Money:Credit Card,"Malware capable of secretly recording payment card details was removed today from the Infowars online store after ZDNet reached out to the company's staff. The malware works by recording payment card details entered inside store checkout forms and then sending the data to remote servers. De Groot spotted the malware infection on the Infowars online store using a powerful malware scanner that he built a few years back and which is specialized in detecting vulnerabilities and infections in online stores built on top of the Magento e-commerce platform. This piece of code -also referred to as a card skimmer, or skimmer- was present on all Infowars store pages, but it only activated during the checkout process. The report, summarized in this ZDNet piece, presented the tactics and histories of seven different cyber-criminal operations that have deployed Magecart-like card skimming malware on online stores in the past four years. Albeit the Dutch researcher shared technical details on how the Infowars store was infected with the card skimmer, ZDNet will refrain from publishing such information to avoid putting future Infowars customers at unnecessary risk. Just yesterday, de Groot published research revealing that one in five online stores that suffered a Magecart infection were reinfected, at least once."

In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of companies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 15 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations. Each of the three FIN7 conspirators is charged with 26 felony counts alleging conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Hladyr allegedly served as FIN7's systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme."
Hacktivism:Press,"Bob Diachenko, Hacken.io's director of cyber risk research, earlier this month found the company's MongoDB database on a server, wide open and without a password. The server contained 21,612 records and climbing - representing weeks' worth of data, Diachenko told TechCrunch, prior to blogging his findings. The data included donor email addresses and donation receipts, which included customized links to a donor's tax receipt. It took Kars4Kids two days to pull the database offline after Diachenko warned of the data exposure, he said. Diachenko said that Kars4Kids had told him that customers had been informed, but TechCrunch has found no evidence of the company's claim. A note left in the database by a hacker claimed to have ""Downloaded and backed up;"" the hacker demanded bitcoin in exchange for the data's safe return. The breach represents a portion - though not all - of the cars that Kars4Kids receives annually - reportedly tens of thousands each year."
Money:Credit Card,"Kitronik says a recent data breach impacting online shoppers and involving the potential theft of their financial data is the work of Magecart. The company says that Magecart's payment card-skimming malware was operating on the Kitronik website over the period of August to September, as reported by the Register. Customers of the BBC micro:bit vendor and electronics kit seller may have been impacted by the breach. In an email to customers, Kitronik co-founder Geoff Hampson said that the firm believes ""Only details entered at the checkout stage that might have been taken and as a result, customers that had set up an account prior to August would not have had their address details stolen."" Kitronik has pointed the finger at Magecart for the data breach. Magecart has been connected to attacks which directly inject JavaScript into vulnerable e-commerce platforms in order to embed malware, as well as the compromise of payment systems through third-party applications and widgets. In October, a security researcher uncovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Magento extensions which are being actively abused by Magecart to spread payment-skimming malware."
Espionage,"""Marriott learned during the investigation that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014,"" said the statement. The company said hat it obtained and decrypted the database on November 19 and ""Determined that the contents were from the Starwood guest reservation database."" Some 327 million records contained a guest's name, postal address, phone number, date of birth, gender, email address, passport number, Starwood's rewards information, arrival and departure information, reservation date, and their communication preferences. Starwood said an unknown number of records contained encrypted credit card data, but has ""Not been able to rule out"" that the components needed to decrypt the data wasn't also taken. Marriott-owned Starwood the largest hotel chain in the world, with more than 11 brands covering 1,200 properties, including W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element and more. Starwood branded timeshare properties are also included. The company has begun informing customers of the breach - including in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Given that the breach falls under the European-wide GDPR rules, Starwood may face significant financial penalties of up to four percent of its global annual revenue if found to be in breach of the rules."
Money:Ransom,"The Justice Department has indicted two Iranian men behind the SamSam ransomware attacks - that infected the cities of Atlanta, San Diego and Newark, N.J. - as well as two others who converted the ransom into Iranian riyals. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, ""Extorted victims by leaving a ransom note in the form of a file on each computer encrypted by SamSam Ransomware,"" read the indictment, unsealed Wednesday a U.S. District Court in New Jersey. A SamSam attack crippled a number of systems and services in Atlanta in March and the Port of San Diego in September. The focus on healthcare may be due to the attacker's impression that these will be easier targets, they cybergang behind SamSam does show a preference for easy hits, or that they are more likely to fork over the ransom. Grammatical errors were a clue that the attackers likely didn't speak English as a first language, the attacks didn't rely on the typical badly worded spam email with an attachment. Once the attackers received the ransom, two Bitcoin exchangers, identified by the Treasury Department as Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, turned it into Iranian riyals. ""Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims. As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes,"" Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said in the release."
Money:Credit Card,"The majority of the reporting claimed that the point of compromise was due to a payment software called Click2Gov which was hosted on local servers. All three reports claimed that the point of compromise was the Click2Gov software. In the past 30 days, Gemini Advisory has identified over 12,283 compromised payment cards associated with the Click2Gov breach, of which approximately 4,000 cards are associated with previously unseen Topeka, KS and indicating that hackers still maintain the access to infiltrated systems. Gemini Advisory has provided all of the Click2Gov associated breach information to Federal Law Enforcement and is actively working to assist them in further investigation. Thus, Gemini Advisory suggests that users who are directed to pay through the Click2Gov system identify alternative means of making payments until the system threat has been eliminated. All local municipalities that utilize the Click2Gov software should confirm that the software is up-to-date and fully patched, and contact CentralSquare immediately if assistance is needed. Gemini Advisory is monitoring the development of the Click2Gov incident closely, and in the case that new victims are identified, all clients will be notified accordingly."
Money:Cryptocurrency,"A summary obtained by Hard Fork details 14 different attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges since January last year and calculates the state-sponsored Lazarus group is responsible for $571 million of the ill-gotten gains. Group-IB expects the number of targeted attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges to rise, and not just the ones from Lazarus. It warns the most aggressive hacker groups, usually known for attacking banks, will shift their attention to cryptocurrency exchanges now they know just how lucrative it can be. Fraudsters are even building fake websites using stolen cryptocurrency project descriptions and plagiarized whitepapers, disappearing with investor funds shortly after launching a fake ICO. 51-percent attacks are increasing. Group-IB predict attacks on ICOs will remain a threat for almost every project looking to attract investors. For 51-percent attacks to be successful, bad actors must control a majority of the total computing power utilized by a Proof-of-Work powered blockchain. ""In 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million,"" Group-IB reports."
Money:Cryptocurrency,"Between 11am until 1pm UTC today, DNS traffic - the phone book of the internet, routing you to your favourite websites - was hijacked by an unknown actor. The attackers used BGP - a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world - to reroute traffic to Amazon's Route 53 service, the largest commercial cloud provider who count major websites such as Twitter.com as customers. So far the only known website to have traffic redirected was to MyEtherWallet.com, a cryptocurrency website. The attacks only gained a relatively small amount of currency from MyEtherWallet.com - however their wallets in total already contained over £20m of currency. Mounting an attack of this scale requires access to BGP routers at major ISPs and real computing resource to deal with so much DNS traffic. The attackers failed to obtain an SSL certificate while man-in-the-middle attacking the traffic - a very easy process - which alerted people to the issue at scale. The security vulnerabilities in BGP and DNS are well known, and have been attacked before."
Money:Credit Card,"Hackers injected 15 lines of card skimming code on the online retailer's payments page which remained for more than a month between August 14 and September 18, Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at RiskIQ, told TechCrunch. The code siphoned off credit card data from unsuspecting customers to a server controlled by the hackers with a similar domain name - likely to avoid detection. In an email to customers, Newegg chief executive Danny Lee said the company has ""Not yet determined which customer accounts may have been affected."" When reached, a Newegg spokesperson did not immediately comment. Klijnsma called the incident ""Another well-disguised attack"" that looked near-identical to the recent British Airways credit card breach, and earlier, the Ticketmaster breach. Like that breach, RiskIQ attributed the Newegg credit card theft to the Magecart group, a collective of hackers that carry out targeted attacks against vulnerable websites. ""The breach of Newegg shows the true extent of Magecart operators' reach,"" said Klijnsma. Anyone who entered their credit card data during the period should immediately contact their banks."
Money:Credit Card,"If you've booked trips through Orbitz, hackers may have accessed your credit card or other payment card information in a recent attack. Reports from March 20, 2018, state that up to 880,000 payment card numbers and related information could've been exposed in a data breach. In the second disclosure, customer data from other travel sites that used Orbitz to book travel between Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 22, 2017, may have been compromised, according to published reports. The Orbitz breach is a reminder that it's good to regularly review credit card and bank statements, looking for unfamiliar transactions. Keep in mind that it can be safer to use credit cards instead of debit cards when making purchases. That's because debit cards give fraudsters direct access to the money in your checking account. With a credit card, your bank account isn't affected until you make a card payment."

Hacktivism:?,"Panerabread.com, the Web site for the American chain of bakery-cafe fast casual restaurants by the same name, leaked millions of customer records - including names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and the last four digits of the customer's credit card number - for at least eight months before it was yanked offline earlier today, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. The data available in plain text from Panera's site appeared to include records for any customer who has signed up for an account to order food online via panerabread.com. KrebsOnSecurity learned about the breach earlier today after being contacted by security researcher Dylan Houlihan, who said he initially notified Panera about customer data leaking from its Web site back on August 2, 2017. Some of the customer records include unique identifiers that increment by one for each new record, making it potentially simple for someone to scrape all available customer accounts. Another data point exposed in these records included the customer's Panera loyalty card number, which could potentially be abused by scammers to spend prepaid accounts or to otherwise siphon value from Panera customer loyalty accounts. It is not clear yet exactly how many Panera customer records may have been exposed by the company's leaky Web site, but incremental customer numbers indexed by the site suggest that number may be higher than seven million. Update, 8:40 p.m. ET: Almost minutes after this story was published, Panera gave a statement to Fox News downplaying the severity of this breach, stating that only 10,000 customer records were exposed."
PII:?,"A PayPal owned company that processes utility payments for the City of Tallahassee notified about 8,000 customers who used remote location kiosks to pay their bills that a data breach may have compromised their personal and financial information. About 1.6 million utility customers nationwide who use the network were potentially affected by the breach. TIO PayPal notified the City Treasurer-Clerk's Revenue Division on Nov. 10 that TIO services were suspended until further notice because of a potential security breach of its nationwide network. Two days later, Nikolov explained in a follow-up email that PayPal had discovered network security vulnerabilities on the TIO platform and issues with TIO's data security program that did not adhere to PayPal's information security standards. The city posted a notice on its website in November about the suspension of the kiosk payment service and instructed customers to use alternate payment methods. TIO has operated kiosks at more than 40 locations in Tallahassee since 2008.TIO Networks USA President John Kunze followed up with letters dated Dec. 20 sent to customers notifying them ""With an abundance of caution"" that the investigation had uncovered unauthorized access to its network, and to personal information of customers of TIO's clients. ""The PayPal platform, which is separate from the TIO network, is not impacted by this situation in any way and PayPal's customers' data remains secure.""City Treasurer Jim Cooke said the vast majority of Tallahassee electric utility's 100,000-plus customers are not affected."
Hacktivism:Schadenfreude,"As ElasticSearch based leaks become the latest source of massive data exposures, Sky Brasil, one of the biggest subscription television services in Brazil, is the latest to leave its customers exposed after not securing the server with a password. Independent researcher Fabio Castro found the firm exposed the data of 32 million subscribers in 28.7GB of log files and a 429.1GB of API data that revealed names, home addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, client IP address, payment methods, and encrypted passwords. ""The data the server stored was Full name, e-mail, password, pay-TV package data, client ip addresses, personal addresses, payment methods,"" Castro told BleepingComputer. NuData Security Vice President Ryan Wilk said the year has been a particularly bad year for news of the ""Non-breach 'breach'"" of sensitive user PII data. ""The unfortunate mishandling of trusted data by Sky Brasil, and before that Deep Root, data.gov.uk, and WWE continues to show that sophisticated hacking is not required to obtain troves of identity data that can be used to create fraudulent identities or access online personas,"" Wilk said. ""Understanding the user behind the device is key in effect devaluing the stolen identity data to any other person or entity,"" Wilk added. Earlier this week and ElasticSearch server exposed the data of nearly 57M U.S. residents and in another incident London-based Urban Massage app leaks data on 300K customers, including sexual misconduct claims."
Hacktivism:Schadenfreude,"TaskRabbit has a job for cybersecurity experts: find out what happened to their own network. The handyman-for-hire app, which connects workers with people who have a task they'd rather pay someone else to do, sent an alert to its users on Monday, informing them that they were ""Investigating a cybersecurity incident."" While TaskRabbit is conducting its investigation, the app and the website will temporarily be taken down, the email said. TaskRabbit did not specify how many people were affected by the incident, or what information was lost. ""We regret any inconvenience this may cause our clients and Taskers, and will reschedule any uncompleted tasks as soon as possible. For any Tasker who had a task scheduled today and is unable to complete the task, we will compensate them appropriately,"" a TaskRabbit representative said in an emailed statement. On Twitter, TaskRabbit users have sent complaints to the company, pointing out that TaskRabbit's website redirected them to a WordPress page showing the app's Github account. TaskRabbit responded to users on Twitter, writing that it's ""Aware of the technical issue and are on the case!""."
Money:Cryptocurrency,"Phase One of the company's internal technical investigation is complete and a data security incident action plan is underway. The criminal investigation continues and Texthelp is working with the National Crime Agency and The National Cyber Security Centre to pursue the investigation further. Martin McKay, CTO and Data Security Officer said, ""In light of other recent cyber attacks all over the world, we have been preparing for such an incident for the last year. Our data security action plan was actioned straight away and was effective, the risk was mitigated for all customers within a period of four hours."" ""Texthelp has in place continuous automated security tests for Browsealoud - these tests detected the modified file and as a result the product was taken offline. This removed Browsealoud from all our customer sites immediately, addressing the security risk without our customers having to take any action."" Texthelp can report that this attacker did not attempt to extort or ransom money from Texthelp or Texthelp customers. The security breach has already been addressed, however Browsealoud will remain offline until Thursday 15th February at 12:00 GMT. This is to allow time for Texthelp customers to learn about the issue and the company's response plan. ""Phase One of our internal investigation is complete and our customers have been notified. We are continuing to work with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Agency. An additional review will now be conducted by an independent security consultancy.

Money:Bank Transfer,"Hackers used phishing emails to break into a Virginia bank in two separate cyber intrusions over an eight-month period, making off with more than $2.4 million total. The email allowed the intruders to install malware on the victim's PC and to compromise a second computer at the bank that had access to the STAR Network, a system run by financial industry giant First Data that the bank uses to handle debit card transactions for customers. Just eight months later - in January 2017 according to the lawsuit - hackers broke in to the bank's systems once more, again gaining access to the financial institution's systems via a phishing email. Prior to executing the second heist, the hackers used the bank's Navigator system to fraudulently credit more than $2 million to various National Bank accounts. Verizon also told the bank that the malware the attackers used to gain their initial foothold at the bank in the 2017 breach was embedded in a booby-trapped Microsoft Word document. ""In its Coverage Determination, Everest further determined that the 2016 Intrusion and the 2017 Intrusion were a single event, and thus, pursuant to the Debit Card Rider, National Bank's total coverage under the Bond was $50,000.00 for both intrusions,"" the bank said in its lawsuit. On July 20 it filed a response to the bank's claims, alleging that National Bank has not accurately characterized the terms of its coverage or fully explained the basis for Everest's coverage decision."
