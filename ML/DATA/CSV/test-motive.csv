?,"Miscreants gained access to US healthcare billing vendor AccuDoc Solutions' database for about a week in September, exposing the data of at least 2.65 million people. North Carolina-based Atrium Health, a customer of AccuDoc Solutions, this week said it had been affected by the breach. Atrium Health - which repeatedly emphasised its innocence - said AccuDoc had terminated unauthorised access as soon as the breach was identified, closed off the compromised path and rebuilt the affected database. In about 700,000 cases, it also included social security numbers, Atrium Health said - these people will be offered free identity monitoring services. AccuDoc provides billing services - such as preparing paper statements and operating a website for patients to pay for services - to various healthcare providers. The Charlotte Observer reported that Perkins had said ""Anything is possible"" when asked whether the breach might have affected more people. The Register has contacted AccuDoc for confirmation that the breach affected just these two customers."

You should use multi-factor authentication for your Blur account to add an extra layer of security to your account."
?,"CATAWBA COUNTY, NC - In Catawba County, letters are going out to more than 9,000 county employees, family members, and some retirees regarding a computer hack. Emails were sent to all county employees at that time to be on the lookout for identity theft issues. The county has sent out letters to 9,400 people advising them to be on the lookout for any issues that may come up. So far there is no evidence that any compromised information has been used by whoever hacked the system. They believe the hackers got into the system by sending emails to county employees and when someone opened up one of those emails, malware got into the system. Assistant County Manager Mary Furtado, who is among the 187 who had information stolen, is urging everyone to be vigilant against cyber thieves. County officials say the cyber breach has already cost the county $50,000 in deductible fees to the insurance company who is helping to pay for the experts who examined the system and for new cybersecurity efforts to shore up the computer system against hackers."
?,"On October 4th, Pentagon officials were alerted to a data breach that affected its personnel. The data was accessed via a system that maintained travel records. Joseph Buccino downplayed the incident saying that only ""a very small percentage of the total population"" of employees were impacted. It's the nation's largest employer with 1.3 million enlisted men and women and another 742,000 civilian employees. The Department has not named the vendor that was victimized because its investigation is ongoing. This incident underscores the difficulties faced by large, complex organizations and businesses when it comes to securing data. It's hard enough to ensure in-house systems are properly secured."
?,"The attacker initially modified a DNS record for one particular server to point to a server in their possession and to intercept and forward the traffic to the original server that belongs to Fox-IT. This type of attack is called a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Sept 19 2017, 02:05-02:15 Maximum 10-minute time window during which the attacker temporarily rerouted and intercepted Fox-IT email for the specific purpose of proving that they owned our domain in the process of fraudulently registering an SSL certificate for our ClientPortal. Based on the outcome of our investigation, we understood the scope of the incident, we knew that the attack was fully countered and we were prepared to re-enable two factor authentication on ClientPortal in order to make it fully functional again. As mentioned, the attacker was able to redirect inbound traffic to ClientPortal and emails going to the fox-it.com domain for a short period of time. All our sensors do full packet capture and this is what allowed us to determine precisely, beyond any doubt, which information was intercepted by the attacker, the timeline of the event and who was affected by the attack. Once the attack was ongoing, we detected it reasonably quickly: within a few hours compared to the typical industry average of weeks before an attack is detected. We could, within a few hours of finding out about the attack, determine exactly who was affected and what the scope of the attacker was."

?,"On 27 June 2017, GoGet's IT team identified suspected unauthorised activity on its system and a full internal investigation was immediately commenced. Although the investigation by NSW Police is ongoing, it appears that the suspect was accessing GoGet's systems in an attempt to use GoGet vehicles without permission. In the process, as part of his overall activity on the system, it also appears that the suspect has accessed personal information of GoGet's members and individuals who have previously attempted to create a GoGet account. The personal information accessed by the suspect depends on what information was provided to GoGet by the individual when they became, or attempted to become, a member. NSW Police are also investigating whether the suspect was responsible for installing software onto GoGet's systems to access payment card details of a small group of individuals when they signed up to the service through GoGet's website or updated their payment card details. GoGet's number one focus has been to protect its members and any affected individuals and retrieve information potentially accessed by the suspect to prevent any misuse of that information. Has GoGet notified the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner?"
?,"A small number of HSBC online banking customers - less than 1% of accounts - were breached last month by unauthorized users, the bank acknowledged Tuesday. ""We responded to this incident by fortifying our log-on and authentication processes, and implemented additional layers of security for digital and mobile access to all personal and business banking accounts. We have notified those customers whose accounts may have experienced unauthorized access, and are offering them one year of credit monitoring and identify theft protection service."" ""We are reminding our customers to protect access to their banking accounts by regularly changing their passwords, and by using unique passwords they are not using elsewhere, including on any social media accounts,"" Sherman said. When it detected the breach, HSBC suspended online access for affected accounts and required impacted customers to contact it. In 2015, HSBC notified mortgage customers of a data breach that had taken place the year before. Personal information about mortgage accounts was ""Inadvertently made accessible via the Internet,"" including customers' names, Social Security numbers, account numbers, old account information and possibly some phone numbers, the bank said at that time. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation requires companies to disclose personal data breaches to regulators and affected customers within 72 hours of becoming aware of them."

?,"As you can see, during that time, we've made some major changes to the site, and though the design has changed substantially, we've made even more dramatic changes in the back-end. Our best guess is that someone was able to exploit a vulnerability in old, unmaintained code in the site's content management system, and made off with at least some user data, which may be as little as a few user records or, at worst, our entire database. To be perfectly honest, when contemplating what needed to be done to properly move the site to a new platform, I considered just throwing in the towel and going offline permanently. In order to keep your history from the old site, and to make that re-association process as painless as possible, we've written a very simple account migration tool. When you login to the new OSNews site, your password will be encrypted using a modern secure algorithm, which is currently PHP's password hash function, which uses Blowfish or Extended DES and can change over time so we don't repeat any past mistakes.

?,"Online fashion store SHEIN announced a security breach last week that affected around 6.42 million of its customerbase. The company says the breach occurred over the summer, sometime in June, when hackers carried out ""a sophisticated criminal cyberattack on its computer network."" Also: Best Home Security Devices for 2018 CNET. No technical details were provided about how the actual breach went down, but SHEIN said the intruders managed to gain access to customers' email addresses and encrypted passwords for its online store accounts. The company discovered the incident on August 22, according to a press release SHEIN circulated on Friday, September 21. ""We have seen no evidence that your credit card information was taken from our systems and SHEIN typically does not store credit card information on its systems,"" the company said in an advisory posted on its website. By the way SHEIN described the incident, this breach doesn't appear to be related to the recent wave of Magecart hacks -incidents where hackers placed card-stealing code inside the JavaScript files of legitimate sites. SHEIN, also spelled SheIn, is a US-based online store dedicated to women's fashion."

?,"Our first line of defense was to block the offending addresses, but ultimately we needed to enable captcha to stop the attack. After the attack was over, we diagnosed that 124 accounts had unauthorized access from the attack. It seemed like the attack focused on first validating which accounts were vulnerable, perhaps with a plan to later exploit these vulnerable accounts. Thankfully we were able to detect and stop the attack very quickly, and also ensure that any intruders were prevented further access. Protecting yourself against attacks like this is important. We've since beefed up our CAPTCHA protection across all applications and all clients, which has been effective at stopping the attack. CAPTCHA isn't perfect, and some times it's annoying, but it has provided effective protection against this wave of attack."
?,"The United Nations' children's agency UNICEF has leaked thousands of individuals' personal data through its online learning portal Agora. Agora offers courses on child rights, humanitarian action, data, research and is used by UNICEF staff and members of the public. UNICEF became aware fi the incident a day after the email was sent and remedied the situation to ""Prevent such an incident from reoccurring"". Agora users were sent an email explaining the situation which then asked them to delete the spreadsheet full of data they may have received from their inboxes and their recycle bins too. Whether UNICEF will be subject to a GDPR investigation is undetermined as of yet, with some experts thinking that UNICEF may avoid one as it's a United Nations organisation. Clare Sullivan, managing director of CyberSMART told Devex that UNICEF will probably be exempt from a GDPR probe as a UN body but it's something that still hasn't been tested in court. Mekki took a more absolute approach when addressing the question and said: ""UN entities are not subject to GDPR"" and that UNICEF did not report the case to authorities."

The online education platform for developers Thinkful has suffered a data breach, just a few days after it has announced it would be acquired by the education tech firm Chegg for $80 million. The company is notifying the incident to its users via email and is forcing a password reset in response to the incident. ""We recently discovered that an unauthorized party may have gained access to certain Thinkful company credentials so, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all of our users."" reads the data breach notification sent by the company.

?,"New York regulators are investigating a weakness that exposed 885 million mortgage records at First American Financial Corp. [NYSE:FAF] as the first test of the state's strict new cybersecurity regulation. On May 24, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that First American had just fixed a weakness in its Web site that exposed approximately 885 million documents - many of them with Social Security and bank account numbers - going back at least 16 years. On May 29, The New York Times reported that the inquiry by New York's Department of Financial Services is likely to be followed by other investigations from regulators and law enforcement. First American says it has hired a third-party security firm to investigate, and that it shut down external access to the records. The Times says few people outside the real estate industry are familiar with First American, but millions have entrusted their data to the company when they go to close the deal on buying or selling a new home. ""First American provides title insurance and settlement services for property sales, which typically require buyers to hand over extensive financial records to other parties in their transactions,"" wrote Stacy Cowley. News also emerged this week that First American is now the target of a class action lawsuit alleging the Fortune 500 mortgage industry giant ""Failed to implement even rudimentary security measures."""
?,"A Florida-based ad agency has left a database open on the internet that leaked details about past advertising campaigns, including information regarding medical malpractice cases, and sensitive details about combat injuries sustained by US military veterans. The database, discovered by security researchers from vpnMentor, belonged to X Social Media, an ad company that runs Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns for the legal industry. Data contained in these forms usually included full names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, and details related to their cases - mostly focused on medical injuries. ""The injuries described in the database vary from combat injuries suffered by American veterans to injuries caused by medical devices, pesticide use, medication side-effects, and defective baby products,"" the vpnMentor said in a report published this week. The details about combat injuries not only included information such as the date and place where the injury occurred, but also detailed medical information and mental trauma the person suffered in the aftermath; details that many applications wouldn't want made public. On top of this highly sensitive information relating to various injuries and legal cases, the X Social Media database also contained information about all the company's clients, ad campaign metrics, and even all the company's invoices. The ad agency closed access to its database on June 11, nine days after vpnMentor found the server and notified the company."

""On Friday, July 5, 2019, the City of New Bedford's Management Information Systems staff identified and disrupted a computer virus attack, known as ransomware, in the early morning hours before city employees began the work day,"" according to a New Bedford press release. ""The city's MIS department has now completely rebuilt the city's server network, restored most software applications, and replaced all of the computer workstations that were found to be affected. The attack did not disrupt the city's delivery of services to residents. The city's MIS staff is now addressing the internal impact on city government."" ""The specific virus was a variant of the Ryuk virus, a ransomware virus whose purpose is the financial extortion of a computer network's operator - in this case, the City of New Bedford,"" according to the city's release. In June, dual Florida cities - Lake City and Riviera Beach - were both hit by ransomware attacks and decided to pay off the hackers. The city of Baltimore meanwhile is another high-profile recent victim of ransomware, which hit in May and halted some city services like water bills, permits and more, with attackers demanding a $76,000 ransom. In 2018, several Atlanta city systems were infamously crippled after a ransomware attack extorted the municipality for $51,000."
?,"Twitter today finally decided to temporarily disable a feature, called 'Tweeting via SMS,' after it was abused by a hacking group to compromise Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey last week and sent a series of racist and offensive tweets to Dorsey's followers. Dorsey's Twitter account was compromised last week when a hacker group calling itself ""Chuckling Squad"" replicated a mobile phone number associated with the CEO account and abused this particular feature to post racist, offensive messages and bomb threats from it via SMS. Replicating a mobile phone number associated with someone else is a technique known as ""SIM swapping,"" where attackers social engineer a victim's mobile phone provider and trick the telecom company to transfer target's phone number to their own SIM card. Once they social engineered an AT&T employee and gained access to Dorsey's phone number, the Chuckling Squad hackers used the 'Tweeting via SMS' feature to post tweets under his username, even without actually logging in to his account. For those unaware, Twitter has a feature that gives its users the ability to post a tweet from their account just by sending an SMS message to the company number from their registered mobile number associated with their Twitter account. Twitter says the phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider, allowing an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number pic. The feature still exists and has been misused several times in the past since no authentication is required other than just having access to the linked phone number. In a series of tweets published today, Twitter says it has temporarily disabled this feature and working on improving it by exploring options to offer an authenticated way."
?,"The personal information of roughly 3.1 million Toyota customers may have been leaked following a security breach of multiple Toyota and Lexus sales subsidiaries, as detailed in a breach notification issued by the car maker today. As detailed in a press release published on Toyota'a global newsroom, unauthorized access was detected on the computing systems of Tokyo Sales Holdings, Tokyo Tokyo Motor, Tokyo Toyopet, Toyota Tokyo Corolla, Nets Toyota Tokyo, Lexus Koishikawa Sales, Jamil Shoji, and Toyota West Tokyo Corolla. Toyota has not yet confirmed if the attackers were able to exfiltrate any of the customer personal information exposed after the IT systems of its subsidiaries were breached. ""We apologize to everyone who has been using Toyota and Lexus vehicles for the great concern,"" states Toyota's notification. ""We take this situation seriously, and will thoroughly implement information security measures at dealers and the entire Toyota Group."" This breach comes after Australian Toyota dealers were also targeted by a cyber attack which led to multiple corporate IT systems going down on February 19. A chat with a Toyota Australia dealership employee leads to a reexamination of the impacts & motives of their recent breach."
?,"Personal details from resumes and CVs from job seekers were exposed after a server belonging to a recruitment company that was a customer of Monster.com and others was left unprotected. Monster.com which learned of the breach in August, did not initially alert potential victims to the exposure, contending that notification responsibly lay with the recruitment company that ""Owned"" the data. ""Customers that purchase access to Monster's data - candidate résumés and CVs - become the owners of the data and are responsible for maintaining its security,"" Monster Chief Privacy Officer Michael Jones said in a statement cited by TechCrunch. ""In today's era of growing privacy regulations, how companies react in the wake of a data breach is critical, said Peter Goldstein, CTO and co-founder of Valimail."" ""Monster might have paid careful attention to their internal security practices, but still the data that they are responsible for has been exposed,"" said Pankaj Parekh, chief product and strategy officer at SecurityFirst. ""The exposed resumes give cybercriminals more than enough data to commit phishing attacks and effective impersonation attempts, which can lead to account takeover, identity theft and other scams,"" said Goldstein. ""At least give people a slice of the action when you sell their data."""
?,"Updated Citrix today warned its customers that foreign hackers romped through its internal company network and stole corporate secrets. According to infosec firm Resecurity, which had earlier alerted the Feds and Citrix to the cyber-intrusion, at least six terabytes of sensitive internal files were swiped from the US corporation by the Iranian-backed IRIDIUM hacker gang. ""Based our recent analysis, the threat actors leveraged a combination of tools, techniques and procedures, allowing them to conduct targeted network intrusion to access at least six terabytes of sensitive data stored in the Citrix enterprise network, including email correspondence, files in network shares, and other services used for project management and procurement."" Citrix said it took action - launching an internal probe and securing its networks - after hearing from the FBI earlier this week. Earlier today, Citrix chief information security officer Stan Black gave his company's side of the story. As a massive provider of remote management, networking, and videoconferencing products, Citrix has an extremely large portfolio spread across a number of sectors in the enterprise IT market. For now, Citrix said it is planning to cooperate fully with the FBI probe, and has also brought in an outside security firm to help investigate the intrusion and make sure that hackers will not be able to get back in to the network."
?,"What ties them together is that they both contain data about Facebook users, describing their interests, relationships, and interactions, that were available to third party developers. As Facebook faces scrutiny over its data stewardship practices, they have made efforts to reduce third party access. Data about Facebook users has been spread far beyond the bounds of what Facebook can control today. For app developers on Facebook, part of the platform's appeal is access to some slice of the data generated by and about Facebook users. The data exposed in each of these sets would not exist without Facebook, yet these data sets are no longer under Facebook's control. In each case, the Facebook platform facilitated the collection of data about individuals and its transfer to third parties, who became responsible for its security. The surface area for protecting the data of Facebook users is thus vast and heterogenous, and the responsibility for securing it lies with millions of app developers who have built on its platform."
?,"One bad search on the government website for South Carolina's capital city could've exposed an entire database. The city of Columbia site had a security flaw in its search tool, according to independent security researcher Arif Khan. The flaw let anyone view passwords for the website's database and email protocol servers, creating a massive potential for abuse, Khan said on Thursday. The vulnerability made it possible for someone to ""Pull sensitive data out of the Columbia city government's database,"" Khan said. With access to the email protocol servers, an attacker could've also created spoof emails that looked like they'd come from the city government. He reached out again in October, he said, and another security researcher also publicly contacted the city government in November on Twitter. Cybercriminals often target city governments because they serve an important function and have access to sensitive information."

After de Groot disclosed his discovery to Best of the Web, the company confirmed that their trust seal script which was hosted on Amazon's content delivery network was indeed hacked. As Best of the Web Trust Seal Team said in an email to BleepingComputer:‏. Earlier today, we were notified that the script we use to display trust seals that we host on Amazon's content delivery network was compromised. The keystroke logging scripts found by the researcher were encoded but de Groot managed to decode them, with the decoded versions of the JavaScript-based keyloggers being available on GitHub Gist and the obfuscated versions HERE. A list of some of the websites where the compromised trust seal script is present can be found via a PublicWWW scan, with over 100 of them still linking to compromised versions of the script. Cybercriminals have targeted multiple targets since the start of 2019 as part of supply chain attacks, with hundreds of websites being impacted after hackers managed to compromise an advertising script from French online advertiser Adverline they later used to inject a MageCart payment info skimmer into hundreds of sites in January. Last but not least, in May, a JavaScript-based payment card skimming script was injected in the checkout pages of hundreds of online campus stores powered by the PrismWeb e-commerce platform."
?,"The intrusion originated on May 5 when a build deployed to the development tier for stackoverflow.com contained a bug, which allowed an attacker to log in to our development tier as well as escalate their access on the production version of stackoverflow.com. On May 11, the intruder made a change to our system to grant themselves a privileged access on production. This change was quickly identified and we revoked their access network-wide, began investigating the intrusion, and began taking steps to remediate the intrusion. As part of our security procedures to protect sensitive customer data, we maintain separate infrastructure and networks for clients of our Teams, Business, and Enterprise products and we have found no evidence that those systems or customer data were accessed. Our team has taken, and continues to take, a number of steps as part of our response to this incident, including: Terminating the unauthorized access to the system. Remediating the original issues that allowed the unauthorized access and escalation, as well as any other potential vectors that we have found during the investigation. Taking precautionary measures such as cycling secrets, resetting company passwords, and evaluating systems and security levels."
?,"Microsoft today released an updated version of its ""Outlook for Android"" that patches an important security vulnerability in the popular email app that is currently being used over 100 million users. According to an advisory, Outlook app with versions before 3.0.88 for Android contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the way the app parses incoming email messages. If exploited, remote attackers can execute malicious in-app client-side code on the targeted devices just by sending them emails with a specially crafted message. ""The attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on the affected systems and run scripts in the security context of the current user."" According to Microsoft, the flaw was responsibly reported by multiple security researchers independently and could potentially lead to spoofing attacks. The technical details or any proof-of-concept of this flaw is not yet available in public and Microsoft is currently not aware of any attack in the wild related to this issue. If your android device hasn't updated automatically yet, you are advised to manually update your Outlook app from the Google Play Store."
?,"According to a report from the US Office of the Inspector General, someone connected an unauthorized Raspberry Pi to a JPL network, giving hackers a way into the systems. The comprehensive federal review of JPL's systems stemmed from an April 2018 incident when someone at JPL attached the Raspberry Pi to the network there for an unknown purpose. It was apparently quite simple for the unknown attackers to get into the systems attached to the same network as the Raspberry Pi. While inside JPL's network, the hackers reportedly stole about 500MB of data related to human spaceflight. After ransacking the JPL computers, the attackers found a route deeper into JPL's network. The security breach was so severe that officials at Johnson Space Center decided to disconnect from the JPL network to protect projects like the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and International Space Station. The OIG lambasts JPL for the shared nature of its network. The system JPL uses to track network hardware is apparently woefully incomplete and poorly maintained."
?,"A digital intrusion at PCM Inc., a major U.S.-based cloud solution provider, allowed hackers to access email and file sharing systems for some of the company's clients, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. El Segundo, Calif. based PCM is a provider of technology products, services and solutions to businesses as well as state and federal governments. PCM has nearly 4,000 employees, more than 2,000 customers, and generated approximately $2.2 billion in revenue in 2018. Those sources say the attackers stole administrative credentials that PCM uses to manage client accounts within Office 365, a cloud-based file and email sharing service run by Microsoft Corp. One security expert at a PCM customer who was recently notified about the incident said the intruders appeared primarily interested in stealing information that could be used to conduct gift card fraud at various retailers and financial institutions. ""The incident did not impact all of PCM customers; in fact, investigation has revealed minimal-to-no impact to PCM customers. To the extent any PCM customers were potentially impacted by the incident, those PCM customers have been made aware of the incident and PCM worked with them to address any concerns they had."". On June 24, PCM announced it was in the process of being acquired by global IT provider Insight Enterprises. The breach at PCM is just the latest example of how cybercriminals increasingly are targeting employees who work at cloud data providers and technology consultancies that manage vast IT resources for many clients."

?,"Hackers accessed the internal network of Czech cybersecurity company Avast, likely aiming for a supply chain attack targeting CCleaner. Following an investigation, the antivirus maker determined that the attacker was able to gain access using compromised credentials via a temporary VPN account. From the information collected this far, the attack appears to be ""An extremely sophisticated attempt,"" says Jaya Baloo, Avast Chief Information Security Officer. The intruder connected from a public IP address in the U.K. and took advantage of a temporary VPN profile that should no longer have been active and was not protected with two-factor authentication. Suspecting CCleaner as the targeted asset, Avast on September 25 stopped the upcoming updates for the software and started to check prior releases for malicious modification. The old certificate was revoked, says in a statement today Jaya Baloo, Avast Chief Information Security Officer. The company tracked the intruder by keeping the VPN profile active and monitoring the access going through it until mitigation actions could be deployed."
