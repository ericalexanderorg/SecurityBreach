?,"Miscreants gained access to US healthcare billing vendor AccuDoc Solutions' database for about a week in September, exposing the data of at least 2.65 million people. North Carolina-based Atrium Health, a customer of AccuDoc Solutions, this week said it had been affected by the breach. Atrium Health - which repeatedly emphasised its innocence - said AccuDoc had terminated unauthorised access as soon as the breach was identified, closed off the compromised path and rebuilt the affected database. In about 700,000 cases, it also included social security numbers, Atrium Health said - these people will be offered free identity monitoring services. AccuDoc provides billing services - such as preparing paper statements and operating a website for patients to pay for services - to various healthcare providers. The Charlotte Observer reported that Perkins had said ""Anything is possible"" when asked whether the breach might have affected more people. The Register has contacted AccuDoc for confirmation that the breach affected just these two customers."
ATT&CK:T1078,"A hacker has been able to send messages via text, email, and landline to tens of thousands of people across Australia after an emergency warning alert service, used by councils, was hacked. The message sent from the Early Warning Network on Friday night warned ""EWN has been hacked. Your personal data is not safe. Trying to fix the security issues"". EWN said a hacker accessed its alerting system and sent the message to part of its database. ""EWN staff at the time were able to quickly identify the attack and shut off our systems limiting the amount of messages sent out. Unfortunately, a small proportion of our database received this alert."" ""The actual data held in our system is just 'white pages' type data, we deliberately don't hold any other personal information."" The company said it's warning system remained fully operational during the breach and that it was working with the Queensland Police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre on the investigation. Mr Plowright said in the case of the NT, the EWN would usually be responsible for providing data to a number of ""Blue chip"" clients, including councils, regarding when and how a cyclone could hit."
ATT&CK:T1078,"The Indiana Department of Insurance is investigating a recent data breach suffered by Bankers Life and Casualty Co., a division of Carmel-based insurance holding company CNO Financial Group Inc. Bankers Life and Casualty Co. disclosed late last week that it was hit by a data breach between May 30 and Sept. 13, and the hackers were able to gain extensive personal information for a ""Limited group"" of customers. Chicago-based Bankers Life sells financial products to middle-income clients, including Medicare supplement insurance, supplemental health insurance, life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuities. Bankers Life declined to disclose to IBJ details of how the outsiders gained access to employee information, nor would it disclose the number of customers whose personal information was accessed. In a statement released late last week, Bankers Life said that ""Unauthorized third parties"" gained access to a limited number of Bankers Life employees' credentials between May 30 and Sept. 13. In addition to the group whose data was accessed, Bankers Life said, a larger group of its customers may have had their information exposed; including names, addresses, birth dates, the last four digits of Social Security numbers and insurance information such as policy numbers, types of insurance, premiums, dates of service and claims amounts. On Thursday, the company said, it notified certain customers about the issue, including people who hold Medicare supplement policies through Colonial Penn Life Insurance Co., another CNO Financial unit. The Indiana Department of Insurance said consumers concerned about cybersecurity can get more information here."

ATT&CK:T1326,"Unknown hackers have hijacked the DNS server for BlackWallet. The attack happened late Saturday afternoon, January 13, when the attackers hijacked the DNS entry of the BlackWallet. ""The DNS hijack of Blackwallet injected code,"" said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who analyzed the code before the BlackWallet team regained access over their domain and took down the site. The BlackWallet team and other XLM owners have tried to warn users via alerts on Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, the Stellar Community and GalacticTalk forums, but to no avail, as users continued to log into the rogue BlackWallet. BlackWallet admins are now desperately trying to catch Bittrex's attention to block the hackers' account. According to the BlackWallet admin, the incident took place after someone accessed his hosting provider account. ""Please note however that blackwallet was only an account viewer and that no keys were stored on the server!""."
OWASP:A5,"Blind said that the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to ""a single server, one among many servers on our platform,"" according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email. Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members, but not the associated email addresses of each user. Blind claims on its website that its email verification ""Is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process."" It adds: ""This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can't do it."" Blind claims that the database ""Does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames,"" but we found did find streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. When other records didn't store an email address, the record contained the user's email as an unrecognized encrypted hash - which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else. Despite the company's apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens - the same kind of tokens that recently put Microsoft and Facebook accounts at risk. Some users sent anonymous, private messages in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails."

OWASP:A10,"Logo ... How Bulletproof Coffee markets itself on its website. Bulletproof 360 Inc., purveyors of the fatty coffee touted as a wonder-treatment for mental clarity and weight loss, admitted that from May 20 to October 19 of this year - minus one day on October 14 - hackers slurped sensitive personal information hipsters entered when purchasing stuff online. ""In mid-October 2017, Bulletproof identified unauthorized computer code that had been added to the software that operates the checkout page at www.bulletproof.com,"" Bulletproof said in its mea culpa notification letter [PDF] to customers. Bulletproof said it is ""Working diligently"" to shore up its web systems after its security went to pot, and has vowed to prevent future similar attacks. As is usually the case with these sort of cockups, Bulletproof is advising its caffeine addicts to keep a close eye on their bank statements for any unauthorized charges brewing. The network security breach is particularly grinding for Bulletproof given its tech pedigree and the firm's particular appeal in Silicon Valley. Bulletproof got into the public spotlight on the back of endorsements from VC and startup execs in the tech world."
ATT&CK:T1078,"According to a letter of warning sent out recently the Orange County, Calif., branch of the Girl Scouts experienced a data breach. The data breach, which is estimated to affect almost 3,000 members, occurred over the course of one day toward the end of September. An unknown third-party attacker was able to gain access to the email , which then allowed them to send numerous emails to various strategic locations. The data contained within these records include full legal birth names, home addresses, driver's license numbers, health history, and even insurance policy numbers. In the aftermath of the breach, the Girl Scouts of Orange County notified the attorney general in California of the incident. The letter also stated that the Girl Scouts went through their emails and deleted any that contained personal data. Finally, Christina Salcido stated that the Girl Scouts are beefing up their security by ""Implementing a secure online system for Troop Travel forms,"" as well as other undisclosed security hardening efforts being developed with their IT team."
?,"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield on Wednesday said it had been hit with a data breach that compromised the personal information on approximately 1.1 million customers. As I noted in this Feb. 9, 2015 story, Anthem was breached not long after a malware campaign was erected that mimicked Anthem's domain names at the time of the breach. On Feb. 27, 2015, ThreatConnect published more information tying the same threat actors and modus operandi to a domain called ""Prennera[dot]com"". ""It is believed that the prennera[dot]com domain may have been impersonating the Healthcare provider Premera Blue Cross, where the attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the 'm' with two 'n' characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would be seen five months later with the we11point[dot]com command and control infrastructure,"" ThreatConnect observed in a February 2015 blog post. Turns out, the same bulk registrant in China that registered the phony Premera and Anthem domains in April 2014 also registered two Carefirst look-alike domains - careflrst[dot]com and caref1rst[dot]com. ThreatConnect has unearthed evidence showing the same tactics were used on EmpireB1ue.com, a domain registered April 11, 2014. EmpireBlue BlueCross BlueShield was one of the organizations impacted by the Anthem breach."
?,"US coffee store chain Caribou Coffee announced a security breach today after it discovered unauthorized access of its point of sale systems. All customers who used a credit or debit card at one of the affected stores between August 28, 2018, and December 3, 2018, should consider their card details compromised and take precautions such as asking for a card replacement, reviewing credit card reports, and enrolling in identity protection programs. Users can consult the list of impacted stores via the company's data breach notice, posted on its homepage. Caribou Coffee officials said they detected that something was wrong last month, on November 28, when its IT staff was alerted of ""Unusual activity"" on its network via its security monitoring processes. Two days later, Mandiant informed Caribou Coffee that it discovered unauthorized access of the company's POS system that also exposed some of the coffee store's customer data. Caribou Coffee said that names, card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes might have been exposed and collected by intruders. ""At this time, we are confident that the breach has been contained,"" said Caribou Coffee officials."
OWASP:A9,"Britain's data privacy watchdog has imposed one of its largest fines ever against retailer Carphone Warehouse over a massive data breach it suffered in 2015. The data breach of Carphone Warehouse affected its online division, which operates the OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk websites, and resulted in unauthorized access to the personal data of 3.3 million customers and 1,000 employees. ""A company as large, well-resourced and established as Carphone Warehouse should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks,"" U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham says. Because the ICO offers a 20 percent discount on fines that are paid within one month, it's expected that Carphone Warehouse will ultimately pay &pound320,000. While the ICO's breach report says there was ""No single root cause"" of the attack, it appeared to involve compromising a vulnerable WordPress installation that ""Was considerably out-of-date, exposed to the internet and suffered from multiple vulnerabilities."" Via WordPress, the attacker uploaded web shells that gave them file management and database access rights, the ICO says, at which point the attacker recovered credentials being stored in plaintext that led to the attacker accessing the databases that exposed customer data. The size of the fine against Carphone Warehouse equals the ICO's record fine for London-based telecommunications giant TalkTalk in October 2015. The Carphone Warehouse penalty comes just months before the EU begins enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation on May 25, 2018."
?,"CATAWBA COUNTY, NC - In Catawba County, letters are going out to more than 9,000 county employees, family members, and some retirees regarding a computer hack. Emails were sent to all county employees at that time to be on the lookout for identity theft issues. The county has sent out letters to 9,400 people advising them to be on the lookout for any issues that may come up. So far there is no evidence that any compromised information has been used by whoever hacked the system. They believe the hackers got into the system by sending emails to county employees and when someone opened up one of those emails, malware got into the system. Assistant County Manager Mary Furtado, who is among the 187 who had information stolen, is urging everyone to be vigilant against cyber thieves. County officials say the cyber breach has already cost the county $50,000 in deductible fees to the insurance company who is helping to pay for the experts who examined the system and for new cybersecurity efforts to shore up the computer system against hackers."
?,"The breach involved private user information, including phone numbers, dates of birth, frequent flier membership numbers and passport and government ID numbers, as well as information on passengers' past travels. The airline said that 27 credit card numbers - but not their corresponding security codes - had been obtained, as had 403 expired credit card numbers. The company said that no passwords were compromised, and that the breach would not affect flight operations or safety. The security breach has come at a tough time for the company, which counts the state-backed carrier Air China as a major shareholder. In an era when issues of data protection have come to the fore in Washington and other global capitals, the Cathay breach does not stand out for its scale. The airline said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that around 860,000 passport numbers and 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers had been exposed. Delta Air Lines said earlier this year that customer payment information had been exposed after a security breach at a company that provided online chat services for it."

ATT&CK:T1193,"Three high-ranking members of a sophisticated international cybercrime group operating out of Eastern Europe have been arrested and are currently in custody facing charges filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes for the Western District of Washington and Special Agent in Charge Jay S. Tabb Jr. of the FBI Seattle Field Office. According to three federal indictments unsealed today, Ukrainian nationals Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33, and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are members of a prolific hacking group widely known as FIN7. Since at least 2015, FIN7 members engaged in a highly sophisticated malware campaign targeting more than 100 U.S. companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. As set forth in indictments, FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers, which the group used or sold for profit. In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of companies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 15 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations. Each of the three FIN7 conspirators is charged with 26 felony counts alleging conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Hladyr allegedly served as FIN7's systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme."
?,"UPDATE: Coincheck has detailed its compensation policy for customers whose XEM was stolen. To recap: Coincheck confirmed Friday that the hack, now likely the largest ever in the space, occurred on its servers early afternoon local time in Tokyo. Neither Coincheck nor XEM are as systemically important as Gox and bitcoin were four years ago. Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, calculated that the Mt. Gox hack represented roughly 5 percent of all crypto assets' aggregate network value at the time. In contrast, the Coincheck theft represents less than 0.25 percent of the aggregate value, meaning ""The impact of the Mt. Gox hack was more than an order of magnitude greater on the crypto markets at the time,"" he said. Another difference is that the Coincheck customers have some hope of being repaid, whereas most of the bitcoins stolen from Gox were never recovered and its users were not made whole. During a press conference Friday, Coincheck executives indicated customers would be compensated for their stolen crypto, though it is unclear at this time whether they would be fully reimbursed."
?,"Cloud-based human resources company ComplyRight said this week that a security breach of its Web site may have jeopardized sensitive consumer information - including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and Social Security numbers - from tax forms submitted by the company's thousands of clients on behalf of employees. Pompano Beach, Fla-based ComplyRight began mailing breach notification letters to affected consumers late last week, but the form letters are extremely vague about the scope and cause of the breach. On Wednesday evening, ComplyRight posted additional facts about the incident on its site, saying a recently completed investigation suggests that fewer than 10 percent of individuals with tax forms prepared on the ComplyRight platform were impacted. ComplyRight includes information about its tax solutions division here and it appears that they also file Affordable Care Act and HIPAA paperwork. Again, neither ComplyRight nor its parent firm responded to multiple requests for comment. People who received a letter from ComplyRight may also file a Form 14039 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to help reduce the likelihood of becoming victims of tax refund fraud, an increasingly common scam in which fraudsters file a tax refund request with the IRS in your name and then pocket the refund money. Update, July 23, 8:00 a.m. ET: In a breach notice sent to Wisconsin's department of consumer protection, ComplyRight said its data breach affected 662,000 people."

Joseph Buccino downplayed the incident saying that only ""a very small percentage of the total population"" of employees were impacted. It's the nation's largest employer with 1.3 million enlisted men and women and another 742,000 civilian employees. The Department has not named the vendor that was victimized because its investigation is ongoing. This incident underscores the difficulties faced by large, complex organizations and businesses when it comes to securing data. It's hard enough to ensure in-house systems are properly secured."

OWASP:A5,"You've probably never heard of the marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis. Earlier this month, security researcher Vinny Troia discovered that Exactis, a data broker based in Palm Coast, Florida, had exposed a database that contained close to 340 million individual records on a publicly accessible server. The haul comprises close to 2 terabytes of data that appears to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults, as well as millions of businesses. While the precise number of individuals included in the data isn't clear-and the leak doesn't seem to contain credit card information or Social Security numbers-it does go into minute detail for each individual listed, including phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and other highly personal characteristics for every name. Exactis did not respond to multiple calls and emails from WIRED asking for comment on its data leak. Aside from the sheer breadth of the Exactis leak, it may be even more remarkable for its depth: Each record contains entries that go far beyond contact information and public records to include more than 400 variables on a vast range of specific characteristics: whether the person smokes, their religion, whether they have dogs or cats, and interests as varied as scuba diving and plus-size apparel. While the lack of financial information or Social Security numbers means the database isn't a straightforward tool for identity theft, the depth of personal info nonetheless could help scammers with other forms of social engineering, says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center."

?,"On 27 June 2017, GoGet's IT team identified suspected unauthorised activity on its system and a full internal investigation was immediately commenced. Although the investigation by NSW Police is ongoing, it appears that the suspect was accessing GoGet's systems in an attempt to use GoGet vehicles without permission. In the process, as part of his overall activity on the system, it also appears that the suspect has accessed personal information of GoGet's members and individuals who have previously attempted to create a GoGet account. The personal information accessed by the suspect depends on what information was provided to GoGet by the individual when they became, or attempted to become, a member. NSW Police are also investigating whether the suspect was responsible for installing software onto GoGet's systems to access payment card details of a small group of individuals when they signed up to the service through GoGet's website or updated their payment card details. GoGet's number one focus has been to protect its members and any affected individuals and retrieve information potentially accessed by the suspect to prevent any misuse of that information.

?,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a post buried on its website that the hackers obtained ""Inappropriate access"" to a number of broker and agent accounts, which ""Engaged in excessive searching"" of the government's healthcare marketplace systems. In a letter sent to affected customers this week, CMS disclosed that sensitive personal data - including partial Social Security numbers, immigration status and some tax information - may have been taken. Other information provided on the application, including expected income, tax filing status, family relationships, whether the applicant is a citizen or an immigrant, immigration document types and numbers, employer name, whether the applicant was pregnant, and whether the applicant already had health insurance;. Information provided by other federal agencies and data sources to confirm the information provided on the application, and whether the Marketplace asked the applicant for documents or explanations;. The government said that no bank account information - including credit card numbers, or diagnostic and treatment information - was taken. ""Not only can the attacker steal the identity of anyone in the breach, but they can also use this information to appear credible when crafting mobile spear-phishing messages against their targets."" ""This is especially true if the data that was leaked is accurate, as health information, family relationships and insurance information can make it extremely easy for an attacker to steal the identity of anyone affected by the breach,"" he said."
ATT&CK:T1078,"A small number of HSBC online banking customers - less than 1% of accounts - were breached last month by unauthorized users, the bank acknowledged Tuesday. ""We responded to this incident by fortifying our log-on and authentication processes, and implemented additional layers of security for digital and mobile access to all personal and business banking accounts. We have notified those customers whose accounts may have experienced unauthorized access, and are offering them one year of credit monitoring and identify theft protection service."" ""We are reminding our customers to protect access to their banking accounts by regularly changing their passwords, and by using unique passwords they are not using elsewhere, including on any social media accounts,"" Sherman said. When it detected the breach, HSBC suspended online access for affected accounts and required impacted customers to contact it. In 2015, HSBC notified mortgage customers of a data breach that had taken place the year before. Personal information about mortgage accounts was ""Inadvertently made accessible via the Internet,"" including customers' names, Social Security numbers, account numbers, old account information and possibly some phone numbers, the bank said at that time. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation requires companies to disclose personal data breaches to regulators and affected customers within 72 hours of becoming aware of them."
OWASP:A10,"Malware capable of secretly recording payment card details was removed today from the Infowars online store after ZDNet reached out to the company's staff. The malware works by recording payment card details entered inside store checkout forms and then sending the data to remote servers. De Groot spotted the malware infection on the Infowars online store using a powerful malware scanner that he built a few years back and which is specialized in detecting vulnerabilities and infections in online stores built on top of the Magento e-commerce platform. This piece of code -also referred to as a card skimmer, or skimmer- was present on all Infowars store pages, but it only activated during the checkout process. The report, summarized in this ZDNet piece, presented the tactics and histories of seven different cyber-criminal operations that have deployed Magecart-like card skimming malware on online stores in the past four years. Albeit the Dutch researcher shared technical details on how the Infowars store was infected with the card skimmer, ZDNet will refrain from publishing such information to avoid putting future Infowars customers at unnecessary risk. Just yesterday, de Groot published research revealing that one in five online stores that suffered a Magecart infection were reinfected, at least once."
OWASP:A5,"Bob Diachenko, Hacken.io's director of cyber risk research, earlier this month found the company's MongoDB database on a server, wide open and without a password. The server contained 21,612 records and climbing - representing weeks' worth of data, Diachenko told TechCrunch, prior to blogging his findings. The data included donor email addresses and donation receipts, which included customized links to a donor's tax receipt. It took Kars4Kids two days to pull the database offline after Diachenko warned of the data exposure, he said. Diachenko said that Kars4Kids had told him that customers had been informed, but TechCrunch has found no evidence of the company's claim. A note left in the database by a hacker claimed to have ""Downloaded and backed up;"" the hacker demanded bitcoin in exchange for the data's safe return. The breach represents a portion - though not all - of the cars that Kars4Kids receives annually - reportedly tens of thousands each year."
OWASP:A10,"Kitronik says a recent data breach impacting online shoppers and involving the potential theft of their financial data is the work of Magecart. The company says that Magecart's payment card-skimming malware was operating on the Kitronik website over the period of August to September, as reported by the Register. Customers of the BBC micro:bit vendor and electronics kit seller may have been impacted by the breach. In an email to customers, Kitronik co-founder Geoff Hampson said that the firm believes ""Only details entered at the checkout stage that might have been taken and as a result, customers that had set up an account prior to August would not have had their address details stolen."" Kitronik has pointed the finger at Magecart for the data breach. Magecart has been connected to attacks which directly inject JavaScript into vulnerable e-commerce platforms in order to embed malware, as well as the compromise of payment systems through third-party applications and widgets. In October, a security researcher uncovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Magento extensions which are being actively abused by Magecart to spread payment-skimming malware."

Marriott-owned Starwood the largest hotel chain in the world, with more than 11 brands covering 1,200 properties, including W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element and more. Starwood branded timeshare properties are also included. The company has begun informing customers of the breach - including in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Given that the breach falls under the European-wide GDPR rules, Starwood may face significant financial penalties of up to four percent of its global annual revenue if found to be in breach of the rules."
ATT&CK:T1078,"The Justice Department has indicted two Iranian men behind the SamSam ransomware attacks - that infected the cities of Atlanta, San Diego and Newark, N.J. - as well as two others who converted the ransom into Iranian riyals. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, ""Extorted victims by leaving a ransom note in the form of a file on each computer encrypted by SamSam Ransomware,"" read the indictment, unsealed Wednesday a U.S. District Court in New Jersey. A SamSam attack crippled a number of systems and services in Atlanta in March and the Port of San Diego in September. The focus on healthcare may be due to the attacker's impression that these will be easier targets, they cybergang behind SamSam does show a preference for easy hits, or that they are more likely to fork over the ransom. Grammatical errors were a clue that the attackers likely didn't speak English as a first language, the attacks didn't rely on the typical badly worded spam email with an attachment. Once the attackers received the ransom, two Bitcoin exchangers, identified by the Treasury Department as Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, turned it into Iranian riyals. ""Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims. As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes,"" Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said in the release."
?,"The majority of the reporting claimed that the point of compromise was due to a payment software called Click2Gov which was hosted on local servers. All three reports claimed that the point of compromise was the Click2Gov software. In the past 30 days, Gemini Advisory has identified over 12,283 compromised payment cards associated with the Click2Gov breach, of which approximately 4,000 cards are associated with previously unseen Topeka, KS and indicating that hackers still maintain the access to infiltrated systems. Gemini Advisory has provided all of the Click2Gov associated breach information to Federal Law Enforcement and is actively working to assist them in further investigation. Thus, Gemini Advisory suggests that users who are directed to pay through the Click2Gov system identify alternative means of making payments until the system threat has been eliminated. All local municipalities that utilize the Click2Gov software should confirm that the software is up-to-date and fully patched, and contact CentralSquare immediately if assistance is needed. Gemini Advisory is monitoring the development of the Click2Gov incident closely, and in the case that new victims are identified, all clients will be notified accordingly."
ATT&CK:T1193,"A summary obtained by Hard Fork details 14 different attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges since January last year and calculates the state-sponsored Lazarus group is responsible for $571 million of the ill-gotten gains. Group-IB expects the number of targeted attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges to rise, and not just the ones from Lazarus. It warns the most aggressive hacker groups, usually known for attacking banks, will shift their attention to cryptocurrency exchanges now they know just how lucrative it can be. Fraudsters are even building fake websites using stolen cryptocurrency project descriptions and plagiarized whitepapers, disappearing with investor funds shortly after launching a fake ICO. 51-percent attacks are increasing. Group-IB predict attacks on ICOs will remain a threat for almost every project looking to attract investors. For 51-percent attacks to be successful, bad actors must control a majority of the total computing power utilized by a Proof-of-Work powered blockchain. ""In 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million,"" Group-IB reports."
BGP Hijack,"Between 11am until 1pm UTC today, DNS traffic - the phone book of the internet, routing you to your favourite websites - was hijacked by an unknown actor. The attackers used BGP - a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world - to reroute traffic to Amazon's Route 53 service, the largest commercial cloud provider who count major websites such as Twitter.com as customers. So far the only known website to have traffic redirected was to MyEtherWallet.com, a cryptocurrency website. The attacks only gained a relatively small amount of currency from MyEtherWallet.com - however their wallets in total already contained over £20m of currency. Mounting an attack of this scale requires access to BGP routers at major ISPs and real computing resource to deal with so much DNS traffic. The attackers failed to obtain an SSL certificate while man-in-the-middle attacking the traffic - a very easy process - which alerted people to the issue at scale. The security vulnerabilities in BGP and DNS are well known, and have been attacked before."

OWASP:A10,"Hackers injected 15 lines of card skimming code on the online retailer's payments page which remained for more than a month between August 14 and September 18, Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at RiskIQ, told TechCrunch. The code siphoned off credit card data from unsuspecting customers to a server controlled by the hackers with a similar domain name - likely to avoid detection. In an email to customers, Newegg chief executive Danny Lee said the company has ""Not yet determined which customer accounts may have been affected."" When reached, a Newegg spokesperson did not immediately comment. Klijnsma called the incident ""Another well-disguised attack"" that looked near-identical to the recent British Airways credit card breach, and earlier, the Ticketmaster breach. Like that breach, RiskIQ attributed the Newegg credit card theft to the Magecart group, a collective of hackers that carry out targeted attacks against vulnerable websites. ""The breach of Newegg shows the true extent of Magecart operators' reach,"" said Klijnsma. Anyone who entered their credit card data during the period should immediately contact their banks."
?,"If you've booked trips through Orbitz, hackers may have accessed your credit card or other payment card information in a recent attack. Reports from March 20, 2018, state that up to 880,000 payment card numbers and related information could've been exposed in a data breach. In the second disclosure, customer data from other travel sites that used Orbitz to book travel between Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 22, 2017, may have been compromised, according to published reports. The Orbitz breach is a reminder that it's good to regularly review credit card and bank statements, looking for unfamiliar transactions. Keep in mind that it can be safer to use credit cards instead of debit cards when making purchases. That's because debit cards give fraudsters direct access to the money in your checking account. With a credit card, your bank account isn't affected until you make a card payment."
?,"As you can see, during that time, we've made some major changes to the site, and though the design has changed substantially, we've made even more dramatic changes in the back-end. Our best guess is that someone was able to exploit a vulnerability in old, unmaintained code in the site's content management system, and made off with at least some user data, which may be as little as a few user records or, at worst, our entire database. To be perfectly honest, when contemplating what needed to be done to properly move the site to a new platform, I considered just throwing in the towel and going offline permanently. In order to keep your history from the old site, and to make that re-association process as painless as possible, we've written a very simple account migration tool.

The data available in plain text from Panera's site appeared to include records for any customer who has signed up for an account to order food online via panerabread.com. KrebsOnSecurity learned about the breach earlier today after being contacted by security researcher Dylan Houlihan, who said he initially notified Panera about customer data leaking from its Web site back on August 2, 2017. Some of the customer records include unique identifiers that increment by one for each new record, making it potentially simple for someone to scrape all available customer accounts. Another data point exposed in these records included the customer's Panera loyalty card number, which could potentially be abused by scammers to spend prepaid accounts or to otherwise siphon value from Panera customer loyalty accounts. It is not clear yet exactly how many Panera customer records may have been exposed by the company's leaky Web site, but incremental customer numbers indexed by the site suggest that number may be higher than seven million. Update, 8:40 p.m. ET: Almost minutes after this story was published, Panera gave a statement to Fox News downplaying the severity of this breach, stating that only 10,000 customer records were exposed."

The email allowed the intruders to install malware on the victim's PC and to compromise a second computer at the bank that had access to the STAR Network, a system run by financial industry giant First Data that the bank uses to handle debit card transactions for customers. Just eight months later - in January 2017 according to the lawsuit - hackers broke in to the bank's systems once more, again gaining access to the financial institution's systems via a phishing email. Prior to executing the second heist, the hackers used the bank's Navigator system to fraudulently credit more than $2 million to various National Bank accounts. Verizon also told the bank that the malware the attackers used to gain their initial foothold at the bank in the 2017 breach was embedded in a booby-trapped Microsoft Word document.

?,"Survey company Typeform has admitted suffering a breach caused by attackers downloading a ""Partial backup"" of its customer data. Each one of those collects data from possibly tens of thousands of their own customers when they take part, which widens the breach's scope. Each affected provider will therefore need to contact these customers independently - a situation that draws parallels with the breach suffered by email marketing provider Epsilon in 2011, which saw dozens of large brands sending out apology emails. Our initial investigations suggest that some personal data of about 20,000 people is likely to have been included in the breach. Typeform is vague about specifics, choosing to mention only what isn't at risk, namely subscription payment data, Typeform account passwords, any payments collected via Stripe integration, and audience payment data. Which brings us to the coalface of this breach - the unknown number of people who have never heard of Typeform, nor realised their data was being stored by them, but who might receive alert emails from the business that used it. If you're unlucky enough to be one of these, it seems the risk is, as stated, receiving phishing scams, that might use personal data from the breach to try to lure you in."

OWASP:A10,"Vision Direct has admitted customers' personal and financial data was leaked earlier this month after hackers compromised the company's website. The breach took place between 00:11 GMT on 3 November and 12:52 GMT on 8 November, said Vision Direct, which purports to be Europe's largest etailer of contact lenses and eye care products and services. Customers who logged in during those times to update their accounts, or anyone creating a new account will have been affected and their data exposed, the company confirmed. Vision Direct said that given the nature of the breach, no data previously stored in its database had been affected by the hack. It claimed the breach had been ""Resolved"" and the website was again running normally. Customers with concerns can call the customer services team on 020 7768 5000 from the UK and 1 800 870 0741 from the US. El Reg is already aware of one report of a Vision Direct customer who claimed to have received notification from their bank of multiple transactions of just under £250 made to companies that they'd never heard of. Helms encouraged security folk to follow some advice given by NCSC following attacks earlier in the year when UK government websites were struck with cryptojacking attacks, where the miscreants mined Monero rather than pilfering credit card info."
OWASP:A5,"The server wasn't protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew where to look to peek in and snoop on a near-real-time stream of text messages. Worse, the database - running on Amazon's Elasticsearch - was configured with a Kibana front-end, making the data within easily readable, browsable and searchable for names, cell numbers and the contents of the text messages themselves. It's firms like Voxox that act as a gateway and converting those codes into text messages, to be passed on to the cell networks for delivery to the user's phone. At the time of its closure, the database appeared to have a little over 26 million text messages year-to-date. Many messages included two-factor verification codes for Google accounts in Latin America;. We also found messages that contained Microsoft's account password reset codes and Huawei ID verification codes;. With access to the text message through the exposed database, hijacking an account could take seconds."
OWASP:A5,"The past few days have showered plenty of favorable attention on a new trading platform called DX.Exchange, with glowing profiles by Bloomberg News and CNBC. The only problem is that the site, which allows people to trade currencies and digitized versions of Apple, Tesla, and other stocks, has been leaking oodles of account login credentials and personal user information. Besides spilling user data and allowing unauthorized access to user accounts, the leak puts the entire security of the site in serious jeopardy because some of the leaked tokens appear to belong to employees of the site. In the event that such a token gave unauthorized access to an account with administrative privileges, the hacker might be able to download entire databases, seed the site with malware, and possibly even transfer funds out of user accounts. Ars sent emails to users of eight randomly chosen tokens to ask if they had accounts on the site. A few hours later, officials announced a site maintenance update, but even after the site came back online, the leak continued. The favorable attention showered on DX.Exchange is unfortunate, because it detracts attention from several security weaknesses that should serve as warning signs that the site may not be adequately safeguarding the tremendous amount of sensitive data it requires users to provide. Best practices call for authentication tokens to be time stamped and then signed with a private encryption key each time a user sends it to a site."
OWASP:A5,"An investigation is underway into a booking software vulnerability that exposed airline passenger name records, which is a bundle of personal and travel data that gets collected whenever someone books a flight. El Al uses a booking system from Amadeus, a Madrid-based company based that works with 500 airlines, including United Airlines and Air Canada. Airlines typically issue a six-digit alphanumeric booking reference code whenever someone books their ticket. El Al sends customers a link to a web page to check their PNR. But Rotem discovered that he could insert a random booking reference number into the link. With that information in hand, it's possible to access someone else's booking information using the booking reference number and the last name of a passenger. Global distribution systems, such as the one run by Amadeus and other booking software providers, including Sabre and Travelport, date back decades. ""The way 6-digit booking codes are chosen makes them weaker than a 5-digit password ("". In the short term, Nohl and Nikodijevic recommended airlines employ Captchas and also limit the number of requests per IP address."
BEC:Impersonation,"In a case of business email compromise, Chinese hackers stole $18.6 million from the Indian arm of Tecnimont SpA, an Italian engineering company, through an elaborate cyber fraud scheme that included impersonating the firm's chief executive, the Economic Times reports. The scammers sent emails requesting funds to the India head of Tecnimont, part of the publicly traded Maire Tecnimont, from an account that looked deceptively similar to one used by the Italian group's CEO, and also organized conference calls to discuss a ""Confidential"" acquisition in China, the ET report said. Defending against sophisticated BEC scams can be more difficult than spotting a phishing email, security experts note. According to the report in Economic Times, after sending emails to head of Indian subsidiary of the Milan-headquartered firm, hackers then arranged a series of conference calls to discuss a confidential acquisition in China. Tools such as DMARC, Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance, and SPF, Sender Policy Framework, only work when emails are sent from the same domain name. ""DMARC is a lot about business email compromise, spoofing of email etc, but it works only if hackers are spoofing on your domain. In such cases, SPF policies and DMARC will work and stop you from getting conned,"" says Shomiron Das Gupta, founder and CEO at Netmonastery, a SIEM security and event log management firm. In BEC attacks, the fake message often comes from a legitimate email account that an attacker has gained access to, either through social engineering or a targeted compromise."

OWASP:A1,"LONDON - A recent attack aimed at a U.S.-based oil, gas and chemical supplier leverages the company's use of the enterprise-class Asterisk open-source PBX software, used for VoIP services. According to research from Check Point, presented here at Virus Bulletin 2019 on Friday, the attack was first identified early last year when researchers spotted scanning activity targeting 1,500 unique gateways tied to 600 companies. As a result, the adversary was able to gain complete control over the server, including being able to access databases, call recordings, metadata and detailed information on who called whom and when within the organization. The attacker injected a call file that caused the Asterisk server to make external calls and play canned messages with the identity of the victimized company. The PHP code hooked up with a command-and-control server, and downloaded a password-protected PHP web shell that carried out the data extraction, including the CALL file, which contains metadata on the calls made by the server. The attacker inserted a new CALL file into the outgoing directory, offering the ability to make outgoing calls under the guise of the victimized company. ""The infection vector is a customized PHP web shell, which is weaponized with new techniques targeting the Asterisk internal configuration files and databases - the same databases that hold all of the calls' metadata as well as the recordings of the calls,"" according to the paper."

In the last two days, McAlister's Deli, Moe's Southwest Grill, Schlotzsky's, and Hy-Vee disclosed publicly that their networks were infected with point-of-sale malware copying data from cards used in person at certain locations. Yesterday, the three Focus Brands subsidiaries provided details about a payment card security incident affecting corporate and franchised restaurants. As payment card data passed through a restaurant's server, the PoS malware copied from the card's magnetic stripe the card number, expiration date, and internal verification code; the cardholder's name was also available in some cases. Today's notification from Hy-Vee is an update for communication released on August 14 that informed customers of a payment data card incident discovered at an earlier date. In six locations there are suspicions that the start date for sweeping the card data was November 9, 2018.

?,"Our first line of defense was to block the offending addresses, but ultimately we needed to enable captcha to stop the attack. After the attack was over, we diagnosed that 124 accounts had unauthorized access from the attack. It seemed like the attack focused on first validating which accounts were vulnerable, perhaps with a plan to later exploit these vulnerable accounts. Thankfully we were able to detect and stop the attack very quickly, and also ensure that any intruders were prevented further access. Protecting yourself against attacks like this is important. We've since beefed up our CAPTCHA protection across all applications and all clients, which has been effective at stopping the attack. CAPTCHA isn't perfect, and some times it's annoying, but it has provided effective protection against this wave of attack."

?,"Hackers have breached the infrastructure of Volusion, a provider of cloud-hosted online stores, and are delivering malicious code that records and steals payment card details entered by users in online forms. The incident took place this week after hackers gained access to Volusion's Google Cloud infrastructure, where they modified a JavaScript file and included malicious code that logs card details entered in online forms. The incident is what cyber-security experts call a Magecart attack or web card skimming, where crooks steal payment card details from online shops, rather than ATMs. These types of hacks have been happening for years, but they've intensified over the past two. Most Magecart attacks take place when hackers use vulnerabilities in self-hosted stores to plant skimmer code on outdated online shops. Sometimes, hackers also manage to breach cloud-based platforms - like Volusion - or companies that provide widgets, analytics, ads, or other secondary services to online stores. Something like the latter case happened in May when hackers breached the cloud infrastructure for seven companies that provided services to online stores - namely Alpaca Forms, Picreel, AppLixir, RYVIU, OmniKick, eGain, and AdMaxim. The May incidents were traced to those companies' misconfigured cloud-hosting accounts, which allowed hackers to modify existing files without permission."

The database set-which contains 387,604 records with names, phone numbers, emails, home addresses and billing addresses-was open and visible in any browser for anyone to edit, download or even delete data without administrative credentials, according to Fowler. Data found in the files also included login credentials with hashed passwords for internal users as well as IP addresses, ports, pathways and storage info that could allow potential cybercriminals deeper access to other network resources, he said.

OWASP:A10,"Trend Micro researchers reported that a Magecart group has hacked the websites of two hotel chains to inject scripts targeting Android and iOS users. Researchers discovered a series of incidents involving software credit card skimmer used by Magecart to hit the booking websites of hotel chains. In early September, the researchers discovered a JavaScript code onto two hotel websites belonging to different hotel chains. ""The downloaded script for mobile devices is a credit card skimmer which can steal the information entered on the hotel booking page and send it to a remote server."" Experts noticed that the link would deliver a credit card skimmer script only when users visited the websites using mobile devices, suggesting that the attackers aimed at targeting only mobile users. Although the module was only used for two websites of two different hotel chains, the number of potential victims is very high, as one of these brands has 107 hotels in 14 countries, while the other has 73 hotels in 14 countries. The software skimmer replaces the original credit card form on the booking page, in this way attackers could require customers to submit all credit card data, including the CVC number that is not required in some booking pages."

The experts at Greenbone Networks vulnerability analysis and management company discovered 600 unprotected servers exposed online that contained medical radiological images. PACS servers are used in the healthcare industry to archive images created by radiological processes and to make them available to medical staff for analysis and diagnosis. ""There are more than 737 million images linked to this patient data, around 400 million of which are accessible or can be easily downloaded from the internet. In addition, there are 39 systems that allow access to patient data via an unencrypted HTTP Web Viewer, without any protection."" The researchers used a RadiAnt DICOM Viewer to analyze data from open PACS servers exposed online, they were able to download and view 399.5 million images out of 733.5. Giving a look at the geographic distribution of the PACS servers that were leaking the images, most of unprotected PACS servers is in North America is in the U.S. ""In the US, the number is orders of magnitude higher with 13.7 million data sets and 45.8 million images freely accessible on the internet."" continues the report. In South America, most of the exposed images were stored on PACS servers in Brazil, in the country the experts found 640,000 data sets, and 31.1 million images."
OWASP:A5,"The breach, which reportedly exposed data on millions of passengers, is one of many that have resulted from organizations leaving data publicly accessible in cloud storage buckets. A breach that reportedly exposed data on millions of passengers of two Lion Air airline subsidiaries is another example of the massive exposure that organizations face from leaving data in poorly secured cloud storage. The data belonged to passengers of Malindo Air and Thai Lion Air. A Dark Web operator known as Spectre later dumped four files - two containing data from Malindo and two with data on Thai Lion Air - online, South China Morning Post reported this week. ""Our in house teams along with external data service providers, Amazon Web Services and GoQuo, our e-commerce partner, are currently investigating into this breach,"" Malindo Air said. In June, Australian cybersecurity vendor UpGuard reported on data integration firm Attunity's exposing a terabyte's worth of backups belonging to companies including Ford, Netflix, and TD Bank by putting the data in three publicly accessible S3 buckets. According to UpGuard, organizations can lock down ACLs to an Amazon S3 bucket but still leave data wide open by misconfiguring the bucket policy itself."

The hack targets a flaw in Click2Gov software, which is used in self-service bill-paying portals used by utilities and community development organizations for things such as paying parking tickets online. Out of the eight cities impacted by this most recent breach, six already had systems that were previously compromised in the original breach. ""Some of these victims resided in different states but remotely transacted with the Click2Gov portal in affected cities, potentially due to past travels or to owning property in those cities."" Researchers contacted the eight towns, and while most did not respond, those that did confirmed a breach in their Click2Gov utility payment portals. Several towns took their Click2Gov portals offline shortly after contact. ""The second wave of Click2Gov breaches indicates that despite patched systems, the portal remains vulnerable,"" they said."
OWASP:A5,"Exclusive Tesco has shuttered its parking validation web app after The Register uncovered tens of millions of unsecured ANPR images sitting in a Microsoft Azure blob. The images consisted of photos of cars taken as they entered and left 19 Tesco car parks spread across Britain. Tesco admitted to The Register that ""Tens of millions"" of timestamped images were stored on it, adding that the images had been left exposed after a data migration exercise. Tesco customers across the nation were instructed to use parkshopreg.co.uk to validate their parking with a code printed on their receipts along with their vehicle's registration number, thus avoiding parking charges. Live ANPR images were saved to the blob as timestamped jpegs with the time information also contained within the image filenames, allowing anyone with access to harvest the images in bulk for illicit use. The web app compared the store-generated code with the ANPR images to decide whom to issue with parking charges. A Tesco spokesman told The Register: ""A technical issue with a parking app meant that for a short period historic images and times of cars entering and exiting our car parks were accessible. Whilst no images of people, nor any sensitive data were available, any security breach is unacceptable and we have now disabled the app as we work with our service provider to ensure it doesn't happen again."""

Magecart is an umbrella term given to different cybercriminal groups that are specialized in secretly implanting online credit card skimmers on compromised e-commerce websites with an intent to steal payment card details of their customers. These virtual credit card skimmers, also known as formjacking attack, are basically JavaScript code that hackers secretly insert into a compromised website, often on the shopping cart page, designed to capture payment information of customers in real-time and send it to a remote attacker-controlled server. The newly disclosed campaign doesn't belong to a single group of Magecart hackers; instead, researchers used a source code search engine to search for obfuscated JavaScript on the Internet with malicious patterns that were previously seen in the Magecart's virtual credit card skimmers. According to the researchers, the technique allowed them to quickly uncover more than 80 e-commerce websites compromised by Magecart groups, most of which were found running over outdated versions of Magento CMS that's vulnerable to an unauthenticated upload and remote code execution vulnerabilities. ""Many of the compromised sites are running version 1.5, 1.7, or 1.9. The arbitrary file upload, remote code execution, and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities all affect Magento version 2.1.6 and below. While it can't be stated authoritatively that this is what led to the breach of these sites, these are vulnerable versions of Magento that allow adversaries to inject the formjacking code into the site.""

ATT&CK:T1078,"Twitter today finally decided to temporarily disable a feature, called 'Tweeting via SMS,' after it was abused by a hacking group to compromise Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey last week and sent a series of racist and offensive tweets to Dorsey's followers. Dorsey's Twitter account was compromised last week when a hacker group calling itself ""Chuckling Squad"" replicated a mobile phone number associated with the CEO account and abused this particular feature to post racist, offensive messages and bomb threats from it via SMS. Replicating a mobile phone number associated with someone else is a technique known as ""SIM swapping,"" where attackers social engineer a victim's mobile phone provider and trick the telecom company to transfer target's phone number to their own SIM card. Once they social engineered an AT&T employee and gained access to Dorsey's phone number, the Chuckling Squad hackers used the 'Tweeting via SMS' feature to post tweets under his username, even without actually logging in to his account. For those unaware, Twitter has a feature that gives its users the ability to post a tweet from their account just by sending an SMS message to the company number from their registered mobile number associated with their Twitter account. Twitter says the phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider, allowing an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number pic. The feature still exists and has been misused several times in the past since no authentication is required other than just having access to the linked phone number. In a series of tweets published today, Twitter says it has temporarily disabled this feature and working on improving it by exploring options to offer an authenticated way."

According to Primitive Ventures' Dovey Wan, who first broke the information on social media, hackers managed to compromise a number of Bithumb's hot EOS and XRP wallets and transferred around 3 million EOS and 20 million XRP to his newly-created accounts. The hacker then distributedly transferred the stolen digital assets to his different accounts created on other cryptocurrency exchanges, including Huobi, HitBTC, WB, and EXmo, via ChangeNow, a non-custodial crypto swap platform does not require KYC/account. Last time the popular cryptocurrency exchange was hacked in June 2018, when hackers stole $31 million, and in July 2017, when hackers stole $1 million worth of EOS from many wallets belonging to its users. The above image shared by Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance cryptocurrency exchange, explains how hacker distributed his funds after stealing it from Bithumb.

OWASP:A5,"What ties them together is that they both contain data about Facebook users, describing their interests, relationships, and interactions, that were available to third party developers. As Facebook faces scrutiny over its data stewardship practices, they have made efforts to reduce third party access. Data about Facebook users has been spread far beyond the bounds of what Facebook can control today. For app developers on Facebook, part of the platform's appeal is access to some slice of the data generated by and about Facebook users. The data exposed in each of these sets would not exist without Facebook, yet these data sets are no longer under Facebook's control. In each case, the Facebook platform facilitated the collection of data about individuals and its transfer to third parties, who became responsible for its security. The surface area for protecting the data of Facebook users is thus vast and heterogenous, and the responsibility for securing it lies with millions of app developers who have built on its platform."

The Dukes' new tools use clever tricks to hide themselves and their communications inside a victim's network. The new tools also include lighter-weight implant malware ESET has named PolyglotDuke and RegDuke, each of which serves as a first-stage program capable of installing other software on a target system."
OWASP:A6,"Security researchers have discovered a cryptojacking worm that propagates using containers in the Docker Engine and has spread to more than 2,000 vulnerable Docker hosts. ""The attacker compromised an unsecured Docker daemon, ran the malicious Docker container pulled from Docker Hub, downloaded a few scripts and a list of vulnerable hosts from C2 and repeatedly picked the next target to spread the worm,"" Palo Alto Networks's Unit 42 researchers explained. ""If my host is compromised, the malicious container does not start immediately. Instead, I have to wait until another compromised host picks me and starts my mining process. Other compromised hosts can also randomly stop my mining process. Essentially, the miner on every infected host is randomly controlled by all other infected hosts."" Sending the number of available CPUs on the compromised host to the C2. Downloading a file that contains a list of 2000+ IPs, randomly picking one as the next target and pulling and deploying a malicious Docker image that contains a docker client tool that is used to communicate with other Docker hosts remotely. Picking one of the compromised hosts from the list and pulling and deploying a Docker image that contains a cryptojacking binary on the host. The two malicious Docker images have been downloaded more than 16,500 times, but have since been removed from Docker Hub, along with another cryptojacking image by the same user. ""While this cryptojacking worm doesn't involve sophisticated tactics, techniques, or procedures, the worm can periodically pull new scripts from the C2s, so it can easily repurpose itself to ransomware or any malware to fully compromise the hosts down the line and shouldn't be ignored. If a more potent worm is ever created to take a similar infiltration approach, it could cause much greater damage, so it's imperative for organizations to safeguard their Docker hosts,"" they noted."
OWASP:A5,"With an estimated 15 million subscribers, Adobe Creative Cloud or Adobe CC is a subscription service that gives users access to the company's full suite of popular creative software for desktop and mobile, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, InDesign, Lightroom, and many more. What happened? - Earlier this month, security researcher Bob Diachenko collaborated with the cybersecurity firm Comparitech to uncover an unsecured Elasticsearch database belonging to Adobe Creative Cloud subscription service that was accessible to anyone without any password or authentication. How many victims? - The inadvertently exposed database, which has now been secured, contained personal information of nearly 7.5 million Adobe Creative Cloud user accounts. What might attackers have achieved? - Since the misconfigured cloud database did not include any password or financial information such as credit card numbers, the exposed data is severe enough to expose Adobe CC users to highly targeted and convincing phishing attacks. ""The information exposed in this leak could be used against Adobe Creative Cloud users in targeted phishing emails and scams,"" Comparitech said in a blog post. ""Fraudsters could pose as Adobe or a related company and trick users into giving up further info, such as passwords, for example."" How Adobe addressed the security breach? - Diachenko discovered the exposed database and immediately notified Adobe on October 19. ""This issue was not connected to, nor did it affect, the operation of any Adobe core products or services. We are reviewing our development processes to help prevent a similar issue occurring in the future."" However, it's still unclear how long the database containing records of 7.5 million Adobe Creative Cloud users was exposed before the researcher discovered it."

?,"The City of Baltimore was hit with a ransomware attack in May of this year. City council members alleged a lack of transparency and communication in the wake of the incident, as well as an inability to maintain a functional organization ""During an emergency event."" He also also never drafted a continuity of operations plan for an IT attack of the kind that occurred. Given the fact that $6 million has already been pulled from parks and public utilities funds to ""Harden"" city systems, the $76,000 demand now seems like a bargain. This understatement brought the hearing to a halt as council members expressed their disbelief that city data was not being backed up. City data needed for an audit cannot be recovered because the IT department never made an effort to express the dangers of storing the only copy of data locally. Ars has requested information from the city regarding the contracting details for the recovery, but the city has thus far provided no data. The city figures it will cost $18 million to recover from a rejected $76,000 ransom demand."

?,"A report published today shines a light on one of China's most ambitious hacking operations known to date, one that involved Ministry of State Security officers, the country's underground hacking scene, legitimate security researchers, and insiders at companies all over the world. The aim of this hacking operation was to acquire intellectual property to narrow China's technological gap in the aviation industry, and especially to help Comac, a Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer, build its own airliner, the C919 airplane, to compete with industry rivals like Airbus and Boening. A Crowdstrike report published today shows how this coordinated multi-year hacking campaign systematically went after the foreign companies that supplied components for the C919 airplane. The hacking team targeted companies between 2010 and 2015, and successfully breached C919 suppliers like Ametek, Honeywell, Safran, Capstone Turbine, GE, and others. According to Crowdstrike and a Department of Justice indictment, responsible for carrying out the actual intrusions were hackers that the MSS JSSD recruited from China's local underground hacking scene. The US cyber-security firm points out that in 2016, after almost six years of non-stop hacking of foreign aviation companies, the Aero Engine Corporation of China launched the CJ-1000AX engine, which was set to be used in the upcoming C919 airplane, and replace an engine that had been previously manufactured by a foreign contractor. The full Crowdstrike report gives a glimpse at how China has been using hackers to do so, although they are not the only component."

ATT&CK:T1078,"Norwegian company Visma, who was targeted in the attack, and U.S. company Rapid7 provided support and extensive expertise throughout this research. The attackers then enumerated access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert on APT10 to deliver malware. On the two other victim networks, the attackers deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10. In early 2017, APT10 began conducting attacks against global managed IT service providers that granted them unprecedented access to MSPs and their customers' networks. We were particularly interested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were subsequently compromised by APT10, given their potential access through compromised MSP networks. After almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers used their access to the network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20-encrypted variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading technique. Once on the Visma network, APT10 attackers used the Microsoft BITSAdmin CLI tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled C2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the ProgramDatatemp directory on the infected host."

The company's statement is in opposition to what Der Spiegel reported, with the German newspaper claiming Chinese hackers have been present inside TeamViewer's network since 2014.Hackers deployed Winnti malware. According to Der Spiegel, the hackers who breached TeamViewer's netwok had used Winnti, a backdoor trojan historically known to be in the arsenal of Beijing state hackers. Hackers have always targeted TeamViewer because of the access the company's service can provide, in the case of a successful breach. Months before the successful Winnti hack in the fall of 2016, TeamViewer had faced a wave of user account hijacks, which many customers reported as originating from Chinese IP addresses. TeamViewer is not the only German company that has been hacked and infected with the Winnti malware over the past three years."
?,"The Cloud Hopper attacks carry worrying lessons for government officials and technology companies struggling to manage security threats. Chinese hackers, including a group known as APT10, were able to continue the attacks in the face of a counter-offensive by top security specialists and despite a 2015 U.S.-China pact to refrain from economic espionage. A spokesman for DXC, the services arm spun off by HPE in 2017, said the company put ""Robust security measures in place"" to protect itself and customers. The company called in outside experts, who found infections dating to at least January 2010.Hewlett Packard security staff fought back, tracking the intruders, shoring up defenses and executing a carefully planned expulsion to simultaneously knock out all of the hackers' known footholds. A spokesman for Vale declined to comment on specific questions about the attacks but said the company adopts ""The best practices in the industry"" to improve network security.

?,"The hackers behind the biggest data breaches of the past year have reportedly struck again in a two-fold attack against American Airlines Group Inc. and flight reservation management giant Sabre Corp. that may have compromised millions of people. The Chinese hackers believed responsible for the attack are suspected of having previously stolen medical records and other sensitive personal data belonging to some 80 millions Americans from Anthem Inc., according to sources close to the investigations cited in the Bloomberg report that broke the news. Similar techniques were also used in an earlier hack against hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc. that claimed a more modest but still substantial 4.5 million records. The missing link between the seemingly disparate attacks of the Chinese group is their infiltration into the networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The sources who tipped off Bloomberg to the attacks against American Airlines and Sabre therefore believe that their motivation lied in the fact that the healthcare giant handles insurance claims for several federal branches including the Defense Department's Defense Health Agency. In the likelihood that the hackers managed to get what they were looking for, that means they now not only know the personal, professional and medical histories of millions of government workers with security clearances but also where they traveled.

?,"A thorough investigation into reputed Chinese APT actor Winnti Group turned up a previously undocumented backdoor that was used to compromise a popular Asian mobile hardware and software vendor - perhaps as a prelude to launching a major supply chain attack against its users. ESET does not specifically name the Asian tech company that was targeted by the malware, but does note that it did notify the company and has been collaborating on a remediation of the attack. ESET researchers describe PortReuse as a ""Listening-mode modular backdoor"" that ""Injects into a running process already listening on a TCP port."" In essence, it is reusing an already open port; hence, its name. ESET further reports that PortReuse's initial launch file arrives in one of three formats: embedded in a.NET application the launches the Winnti packer shellcode, a VBScript that deserializes and invokes a.NET object that launches the shellcode, or as an executable with shellcode directly at the entry point. No command-and-control server address is coded into the malware, because it uses NetAgent, a module that handles TCP hooking, to listen in on open sockets for the attacker to connect directly to the compromised host. In some PortReuse variants of, NetAgent and SK3 are packaged together. Knowing the magic packet that triggers the malicious activity, ESET researchers, with assistance from public search engine Censys, scanned the internet for potential victims of the PortReuse campaign and found eight IP addresses that replied with an HTTP response that matched PortReuse's signature."
?,"In 2010 US-based HBGary investigated an information security incident related to the Winnti group at one of HBGary's customers - an American video game company. Interestingly, the digital signature belonged to another video game vendor - a private company known as KOG, based in South Korea. At the same time, in March 2013, Uyghur activists were targeted by other malware, which was digitally signed by another gaming company called MGAME Corp. We believe that the source of all these stolen certificates could be the same Winnti group. During our investigation of an infection at a computer game company, we found that malware had been created for a particular service on the company's server. Any changes the Winnti team introduces into the game experience are unlikely to be very noticeable. Maintaining a skillful balance is the main attribute of online games! Users will simply stop playing if they feel that other players are using non-standard methods to create an advantage beyond normal gameplay or if the game loses its intrinsic competitiveness due to resources or artifacts appearing in the game without the developers' knowledge. At the same time the attackers are keen for the game to remain popular; otherwise, they would be unable to effectively turn all the time and effort of infecting a gaming company into financial gain."

Summary On July 23, German public broadcasters BR and NDR reported1 that the likely Chinese Winnti malware has infected at least six DAX2 corporations. Initially, the collective behind Winnti was motivated by financial gain and the gaming sector was especially targeted. The Winnti hackers were able to directly access Gameforge's databases and modify accounts to become 'virtually' richer. The Winnti malware has also reportedly infected political targets. According to BR findings, victims of Winnti malware include the following: Sector Gaming Software Technology Pharma Chemical Government Government Hotels Airline Targets Gameforge, Valve Teamviewer Siemens, Sumitomo, Thyssenkrupp Bayer, Roche BASF, Covestro, Shin-Etsu Hong Kong Possibly the 'Central Tibetan Administration' via a telecom provider Marriott Lion Air Likely motive Financial gain Industrial espionage Political espionage Personal data collection Comments The case of Winnti is an excellent illustration of a malware initially developed for cybercriminal purposes and which has since been repurposed for cyber-espionage. In an attempt to distinguish cybercriminal and cyber-espionage activities, industry reporting has given several different names to group(s) using Winnti such as Winnti group, Wicked Spider, Wicked Panda, APT17, APT22, Barium, Axiom, Deputy Dog, Dogfish, ShadowHammer, and Blackfly."

City Power said its website was down and that customers would struggle to access a number of services, such as buying electricity, uploading invoices and access to the website. The city of Johannesburg said in a tweet, ""Customers should not panic as none of their details were compromised."" The broad scope of disruption to City Power's databases and other software, impacting most of their applications and networks suggest that the ransomware was able to very quickly propagate internally without impediment. The disruption to their services, as well as consumer backlash, will further compound the pressure on City Power's IT and security teams to rapidly restore systems to a known good condition from back-ups, or chance of paying the ransom. ""To have a fighting chance, cybersecurity teams need to be able to rapidly detect and respond to pre-cursor ransomware actions such as host and file store reconnaissance behaviors and command and control signals that are a pre-cursor to the file encryption activities. As the response time available before encryption occurs can be very short, these are tasks that increasingly need to be automated by augmenting people and processes with AI systems that can work at a scale and speed humans alone simply couldn't match. In ransomware attacks, time is the most precious resource for security teams."" Terence Jackson, Chief Information Security Officer at Thycotic, says, ""It appears that in similar fashion to the attacks that have been plaguing US cities and states, Johannesburg's Power Body operations have been severely degraded by this attack.
