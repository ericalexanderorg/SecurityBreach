Hacktivist,"A hacker has been able to send messages via text, email, and landline to tens of thousands of people across Australia after an emergency warning alert service, used by councils, was hacked. The message sent from the Early Warning Network on Friday night warned ""EWN has been hacked. Your personal data is not safe. Trying to fix the security issues"". EWN said a hacker accessed its alerting system and sent the message to part of its database. ""EWN staff at the time were able to quickly identify the attack and shut off our systems limiting the amount of messages sent out. Unfortunately, a small proportion of our database received this alert."" ""The actual data held in our system is just 'white pages' type data, we deliberately don't hold any other personal information."" The company said it's warning system remained fully operational during the breach and that it was working with the Queensland Police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre on the investigation. Mr Plowright said in the case of the NT, the EWN would usually be responsible for providing data to a number of ""Blue chip"" clients, including councils, regarding when and how a cyclone could hit."

Sincerely, Tamara Pattison Chief Marketing and Information Officer Information About Identity Theft Protection Review of Accounts and Credit Reports: You can regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. You should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page. You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national credit reporting agencies listed below."
Hacktivist,"Blind said that the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to ""a single server, one among many servers on our platform,"" according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email. Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members, but not the associated email addresses of each user. Blind claims on its website that its email verification ""Is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process."" It adds: ""This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can't do it."" Blind claims that the database ""Does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames,"" but we found did find streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. When other records didn't store an email address, the record contained the user's email as an unrecognized encrypted hash - which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else. Despite the company's apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens - the same kind of tokens that recently put Microsoft and Facebook accounts at risk. Some users sent anonymous, private messages in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails."

As is usually the case with these sort of cockups, Bulletproof is advising its caffeine addicts to keep a close eye on their bank statements for any unauthorized charges brewing. The network security breach is particularly grinding for Bulletproof given its tech pedigree and the firm's particular appeal in Silicon Valley. Bulletproof got into the public spotlight on the back of endorsements from VC and startup execs in the tech world."

Criminal:FIN7,"Three high-ranking members of a sophisticated international cybercrime group operating out of Eastern Europe have been arrested and are currently in custody facing charges filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes for the Western District of Washington and Special Agent in Charge Jay S. Tabb Jr. of the FBI Seattle Field Office. According to three federal indictments unsealed today, Ukrainian nationals Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33, and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are members of a prolific hacking group widely known as FIN7. Since at least 2015, FIN7 members engaged in a highly sophisticated malware campaign targeting more than 100 U.S. companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. As set forth in indictments, FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers, which the group used or sold for profit. In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of companies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 15 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations. Each of the three FIN7 conspirators is charged with 26 felony counts alleging conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Hladyr allegedly served as FIN7's systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme."

Hacktivist,"You've probably never heard of the marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis. Earlier this month, security researcher Vinny Troia discovered that Exactis, a data broker based in Palm Coast, Florida, had exposed a database that contained close to 340 million individual records on a publicly accessible server. The haul comprises close to 2 terabytes of data that appears to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults, as well as millions of businesses. While the precise number of individuals included in the data isn't clear-and the leak doesn't seem to contain credit card information or Social Security numbers-it does go into minute detail for each individual listed, including phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and other highly personal characteristics for every name. Exactis did not respond to multiple calls and emails from WIRED asking for comment on its data leak. Aside from the sheer breadth of the Exactis leak, it may be even more remarkable for its depth: Each record contains entries that go far beyond contact information and public records to include more than 400 variables on a vast range of specific characteristics: whether the person smokes, their religion, whether they have dogs or cats, and interests as varied as scuba diving and plus-size apparel. While the lack of financial information or Social Security numbers means the database isn't a straightforward tool for identity theft, the depth of personal info nonetheless could help scammers with other forms of social engineering, says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center."
Criminal,"The data was taken from FastBooking, a Paris-based company that sells hotel booking software to more than 4,000 hotels in 100 countries -as it claims on its website. In emails the company sent out to affected hotels today, FastBooking revealed the breach took place on June 14, when an attacker used a vulnerability in an application hosted on its server to install a malicious tool. According to FastBooking, the intruder stole information such as a hotel guests' first and last names, nationality, postal addresses, email addresses, and hotel booking-related information. The French company has sent emails to each affected hotel with details about the number of affected guests for each entity, and what type of data the attacker stole. Bleeping Computer has learned that FastBooking is also providing templates that each hotel can use to notify former guests of the breach, and templates to notify national data protection agencies about the leak of private guest data and their respective payment card details. The first hotel chain to inform customers of the FastBooking breach is Prince Hotels & Resorts in Japan. The hotel chain said the incident affected 124,963 guests who stayed at 82 of its hotels."
Hacktivist,"FedEx has exposed private information belonging to thousands of its customers after a legacy server was left open without a password. The data, hosted on a password-less Amazon S3 storage server, was secured Tuesday after efforts were made to contact FedEx. It's those unencrypted private customer records that were exposed on the server. The server contained more than 112,000 files, a mix of the completed US Postal Service forms used to authorize the handling of mail, along with identification. Among the exposed files, ZDNet confirmed drivers' licenses, national ID cards, and work ID cards, voting cards, and utility bills. We reached out to several individuals whose data was exposed by the password-less server, who confirmed their details and that they were either FedEx or Bongo customers. The server was secured within a few hours of ZDNet contacting FedEx."

Criminal:Magecart,"Malware capable of secretly recording payment card details was removed today from the Infowars online store after ZDNet reached out to the company's staff. The malware works by recording payment card details entered inside store checkout forms and then sending the data to remote servers. De Groot spotted the malware infection on the Infowars online store using a powerful malware scanner that he built a few years back and which is specialized in detecting vulnerabilities and infections in online stores built on top of the Magento e-commerce platform. This piece of code -also referred to as a card skimmer, or skimmer- was present on all Infowars store pages, but it only activated during the checkout process. The report, summarized in this ZDNet piece, presented the tactics and histories of seven different cyber-criminal operations that have deployed Magecart-like card skimming malware on online stores in the past four years. Albeit the Dutch researcher shared technical details on how the Infowars store was infected with the card skimmer, ZDNet will refrain from publishing such information to avoid putting future Infowars customers at unnecessary risk. Just yesterday, de Groot published research revealing that one in five online stores that suffered a Magecart infection were reinfected, at least once."

Hacktivist,"Bob Diachenko, Hacken.io's director of cyber risk research, earlier this month found the company's MongoDB database on a server, wide open and without a password. The server contained 21,612 records and climbing - representing weeks' worth of data, Diachenko told TechCrunch, prior to blogging his findings. The data included donor email addresses and donation receipts, which included customized links to a donor's tax receipt. It took Kars4Kids two days to pull the database offline after Diachenko warned of the data exposure, he said. Diachenko said that Kars4Kids had told him that customers had been informed, but TechCrunch has found no evidence of the company's claim. A note left in the database by a hacker claimed to have ""Downloaded and backed up;"" the hacker demanded bitcoin in exchange for the data's safe return. The breach represents a portion - though not all - of the cars that Kars4Kids receives annually - reportedly tens of thousands each year."
Criminal:Magecart,"Kitronik says a recent data breach impacting online shoppers and involving the potential theft of their financial data is the work of Magecart. The company says that Magecart's payment card-skimming malware was operating on the Kitronik website over the period of August to September, as reported by the Register. Customers of the BBC micro:bit vendor and electronics kit seller may have been impacted by the breach. In an email to customers, Kitronik co-founder Geoff Hampson said that the firm believes ""Only details entered at the checkout stage that might have been taken and as a result, customers that had set up an account prior to August would not have had their address details stolen."" Kitronik has pointed the finger at Magecart for the data breach. Magecart has been connected to attacks which directly inject JavaScript into vulnerable e-commerce platforms in order to embed malware, as well as the compromise of payment systems through third-party applications and widgets. In October, a security researcher uncovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Magento extensions which are being actively abused by Magecart to spread payment-skimming malware."
Criminal:SamSam,"The Justice Department has indicted two Iranian men behind the SamSam ransomware attacks - that infected the cities of Atlanta, San Diego and Newark, N.J. - as well as two others who converted the ransom into Iranian riyals. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, ""Extorted victims by leaving a ransom note in the form of a file on each computer encrypted by SamSam Ransomware,"" read the indictment, unsealed Wednesday a U.S. District Court in New Jersey. A SamSam attack crippled a number of systems and services in Atlanta in March and the Port of San Diego in September. The focus on healthcare may be due to the attacker's impression that these will be easier targets, they cybergang behind SamSam does show a preference for easy hits, or that they are more likely to fork over the ransom. Grammatical errors were a clue that the attackers likely didn't speak English as a first language, the attacks didn't rely on the typical badly worded spam email with an attachment. Once the attackers received the ransom, two Bitcoin exchangers, identified by the Treasury Department as Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, turned it into Iranian riyals. ""Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims. As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes,"" Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said in the release."
Criminal:Carbanak,"Hackers injected 15 lines of card skimming code on the online retailer's payments page which remained for more than a month between August 14 and September 18, Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at RiskIQ, told TechCrunch. The code siphoned off credit card data from unsuspecting customers to a server controlled by the hackers with a similar domain name - likely to avoid detection. In an email to customers, Newegg chief executive Danny Lee said the company has ""Not yet determined which customer accounts may have been affected."" When reached, a Newegg spokesperson did not immediately comment. Klijnsma called the incident ""Another well-disguised attack"" that looked near-identical to the recent British Airways credit card breach, and earlier, the Ticketmaster breach. Like that breach, RiskIQ attributed the Newegg credit card theft to the Magecart group, a collective of hackers that carry out targeted attacks against vulnerable websites. ""The breach of Newegg shows the true extent of Magecart operators' reach,"" said Klijnsma. Anyone who entered their credit card data during the period should immediately contact their banks."

Hacktivist,"Panerabread.com, the Web site for the American chain of bakery-cafe fast casual restaurants by the same name, leaked millions of customer records - including names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and the last four digits of the customer's credit card number - for at least eight months before it was yanked offline earlier today, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. The data available in plain text from Panera's site appeared to include records for any customer who has signed up for an account to order food online via panerabread.com. KrebsOnSecurity learned about the breach earlier today after being contacted by security researcher Dylan Houlihan, who said he initially notified Panera about customer data leaking from its Web site back on August 2, 2017. Some of the customer records include unique identifiers that increment by one for each new record, making it potentially simple for someone to scrape all available customer accounts. Another data point exposed in these records included the customer's Panera loyalty card number, which could potentially be abused by scammers to spend prepaid accounts or to otherwise siphon value from Panera customer loyalty accounts. It is not clear yet exactly how many Panera customer records may have been exposed by the company's leaky Web site, but incremental customer numbers indexed by the site suggest that number may be higher than seven million. Update, 8:40 p.m. ET: Almost minutes after this story was published, Panera gave a statement to Fox News downplaying the severity of this breach, stating that only 10,000 customer records were exposed."
Hacktivist,"As ElasticSearch based leaks become the latest source of massive data exposures, Sky Brasil, one of the biggest subscription television services in Brazil, is the latest to leave its customers exposed after not securing the server with a password. Independent researcher Fabio Castro found the firm exposed the data of 32 million subscribers in 28.7GB of log files and a 429.1GB of API data that revealed names, home addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, client IP address, payment methods, and encrypted passwords. ""The data the server stored was Full name, e-mail, password, pay-TV package data, client ip addresses, personal addresses, payment methods,"" Castro told BleepingComputer. NuData Security Vice President Ryan Wilk said the year has been a particularly bad year for news of the ""Non-breach 'breach'"" of sensitive user PII data. ""The unfortunate mishandling of trusted data by Sky Brasil, and before that Deep Root, data.gov.uk, and WWE continues to show that sophisticated hacking is not required to obtain troves of identity data that can be used to create fraudulent identities or access online personas,"" Wilk said. ""Understanding the user behind the device is key in effect devaluing the stolen identity data to any other person or entity,"" Wilk added. Earlier this week and ElasticSearch server exposed the data of nearly 57M U.S. residents and in another incident London-based Urban Massage app leaks data on 300K customers, including sexual misconduct claims."
Hacktivist,"TaskRabbit has a job for cybersecurity experts: find out what happened to their own network. The handyman-for-hire app, which connects workers with people who have a task they'd rather pay someone else to do, sent an alert to its users on Monday, informing them that they were ""Investigating a cybersecurity incident."" While TaskRabbit is conducting its investigation, the app and the website will temporarily be taken down, the email said. TaskRabbit did not specify how many people were affected by the incident, or what information was lost. ""We regret any inconvenience this may cause our clients and Taskers, and will reschedule any uncompleted tasks as soon as possible. For any Tasker who had a task scheduled today and is unable to complete the task, we will compensate them appropriately,"" a TaskRabbit representative said in an emailed statement.

TaskRabbit responded to users on Twitter, writing that it's ""Aware of the technical issue and are on the case!""."
Criminal:BEC,"Hackers used phishing emails to break into a Virginia bank in two separate cyber intrusions over an eight-month period, making off with more than $2.4 million total. The email allowed the intruders to install malware on the victim's PC and to compromise a second computer at the bank that had access to the STAR Network, a system run by financial industry giant First Data that the bank uses to handle debit card transactions for customers. Just eight months later - in January 2017 according to the lawsuit - hackers broke in to the bank's systems once more, again gaining access to the financial institution's systems via a phishing email. Prior to executing the second heist, the hackers used the bank's Navigator system to fraudulently credit more than $2 million to various National Bank accounts. Verizon also told the bank that the malware the attackers used to gain their initial foothold at the bank in the 2017 breach was embedded in a booby-trapped Microsoft Word document. ""In its Coverage Determination, Everest further determined that the 2016 Intrusion and the 2017 Intrusion were a single event, and thus, pursuant to the Debit Card Rider, National Bank's total coverage under the Bond was $50,000.00 for both intrusions,"" the bank said in its lawsuit. On July 20 it filed a response to the bank's claims, alleging that National Bank has not accurately characterized the terms of its coverage or fully explained the basis for Everest's coverage decision."
Criminal:Carbanak,"Live Nation Entertainment subsidiary Ticketmaster has admitted it has suffered a serious data breach affecting 40,000 of its British and international customers. Anyone who used the Ticketmaster UK, GETMEIN! and TicketWeb sites to book tickets from February 2018 and 23 June 2018 may have had data compromised, including their name, email address, physical address, telephone number, Ticketmaster logins, and payment card details. On Thursday 12th April , members of the Ticketmaster security team visited the Monzo office so we could share the information we'd gathered. On Saturday, June 23, 2018, Ticketmaster UK identified malicious software on a customer support product hosted by Inbenta Technologies, an external third-party supplier to Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster may end up with questions from the UK Information Commissioner's Office about the apparent delay in telling its customers. What to do? If you're one of the 40,000 account holders that Ticketmaster says was affected by the compromise, you should have received an email telling you to change your account password. Replace your payment cards as soon as you can if you're on the list of Ticketmaster customers known to have been affected."
Hacktivist,"A week after its website was defaced and then taken offline, ticket-selling service Ticketfly confirmed today that its customer database had indeed been hacked, with details of 27 million accounts purloined. The stolen information includes the names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses of registered Ticketfly users, including both ticket buyers and ticket sellers - the numerous nightclubs and other venues who are Ticketfly's primary clients. Credit-card details were not stolen, the statement posted on the Ticketfly site said, and neither were passwords of registered ticket buyers, but there was a possibility that encrypted passwords of Ticketfly clients might have been. On the night of May 30, an unknown person or persons calling themselves ""IsHaKdZ"" hijacked the Ticketfly website, replacing its front page with an image from ""V for Vendetta"" and declaring ""Your Security Down im Not Sorry."" Ticketfly quickly took down the site, stating on Twitter that there had been a ""Cyber incident,"" and didn't bring it back online until June 2. Someone contacted Vice Motherboard on May 31 and claimed to be the Ticketfly hacker, adding that the site's entire customer database had been stolen. The hackers also said they had tried to extort Ticketfly for one bitcoin before releasing the data."
Hacktivist,"U.S. Postal Service just fixed a security weakness that allowed anyone who has an account at usps.com to view account details for some 60 million other users, and in some cases to modify account details on their behalf. In addition to exposing near real-time data about packages and mail being sent by USPS commercial customers, the flaw let any logged-in usps.com user query the system for account details belonging to any other users, such as email address, username, user ID, account number, street address, phone number, authorized users, mailing campaign data and other information. In cases where multiple accounts shared a common data element - such as a street address - using the API to search for one specific data element often brought up multiple records. ""It seems like the only access control they had in place was that you were logged in at all. And if you can access other peoples' data because they aren't enforcing access controls on reading that data, it's catastrophically bad and I'm willing to bet they're not enforcing controls on writing to that data as well."" The USPS appears to have included a validation step to prevent unauthorized changes - at least with some data fields. It does not appear USPS account passwords were exposed via this API, although KrebsOnSecurity conducted only a very brief and limited review of the API's rather broad functionality before reporting the issue to the USPS. The API at issue resides here; a copy of the API prior to its modification on Nov. 20 by the USPS is available here as a text file. The USPS told the OIG it had addressed the authentication problems raised in the audit report, which appear to have been related to how data was encrypted in transit."
Criminal:Magecart,"Vision Direct has admitted customers' personal and financial data was leaked earlier this month after hackers compromised the company's website. The breach took place between 00:11 GMT on 3 November and 12:52 GMT on 8 November, said Vision Direct, which purports to be Europe's largest etailer of contact lenses and eye care products and services. Customers who logged in during those times to update their accounts, or anyone creating a new account will have been affected and their data exposed, the company confirmed. Vision Direct said that given the nature of the breach, no data previously stored in its database had been affected by the hack. It claimed the breach had been ""Resolved"" and the website was again running normally. Customers with concerns can call the customer services team on 020 7768 5000 from the UK and 1 800 870 0741 from the US. El Reg is already aware of one report of a Vision Direct customer who claimed to have received notification from their bank of multiple transactions of just under £250 made to companies that they'd never heard of. Helms encouraged security folk to follow some advice given by NCSC following attacks earlier in the year when UK government websites were struck with cryptojacking attacks, where the miscreants mined Monero rather than pilfering credit card info."
Hacktivist,"The server wasn't protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew where to look to peek in and snoop on a near-real-time stream of text messages. Worse, the database - running on Amazon's Elasticsearch - was configured with a Kibana front-end, making the data within easily readable, browsable and searchable for names, cell numbers and the contents of the text messages themselves. It's firms like Voxox that act as a gateway and converting those codes into text messages, to be passed on to the cell networks for delivery to the user's phone. At the time of its closure, the database appeared to have a little over 26 million text messages year-to-date. Many messages included two-factor verification codes for Google accounts in Latin America;.

Hacktivist,"The past few days have showered plenty of favorable attention on a new trading platform called DX.Exchange, with glowing profiles by Bloomberg News and CNBC. The only problem is that the site, which allows people to trade currencies and digitized versions of Apple, Tesla, and other stocks, has been leaking oodles of account login credentials and personal user information. Besides spilling user data and allowing unauthorized access to user accounts, the leak puts the entire security of the site in serious jeopardy because some of the leaked tokens appear to belong to employees of the site. In the event that such a token gave unauthorized access to an account with administrative privileges, the hacker might be able to download entire databases, seed the site with malware, and possibly even transfer funds out of user accounts. Ars sent emails to users of eight randomly chosen tokens to ask if they had accounts on the site. A few hours later, officials announced a site maintenance update, but even after the site came back online, the leak continued. The favorable attention showered on DX.Exchange is unfortunate, because it detracts attention from several security weaknesses that should serve as warning signs that the site may not be adequately safeguarding the tremendous amount of sensitive data it requires users to provide. Best practices call for authentication tokens to be time stamped and then signed with a private encryption key each time a user sends it to a site."
Hacktivist,"An investigation is underway into a booking software vulnerability that exposed airline passenger name records, which is a bundle of personal and travel data that gets collected whenever someone books a flight. El Al uses a booking system from Amadeus, a Madrid-based company based that works with 500 airlines, including United Airlines and Air Canada. Airlines typically issue a six-digit alphanumeric booking reference code whenever someone books their ticket. El Al sends customers a link to a web page to check their PNR. But Rotem discovered that he could insert a random booking reference number into the link. With that information in hand, it's possible to access someone else's booking information using the booking reference number and the last name of a passenger. Global distribution systems, such as the one run by Amadeus and other booking software providers, including Sabre and Travelport, date back decades. ""The way 6-digit booking codes are chosen makes them weaker than a 5-digit password ("". In the short term, Nohl and Nikodijevic recommended airlines employ Captchas and also limit the number of requests per IP address."
Criminal:BEC,"In a case of business email compromise, Chinese hackers stole $18.6 million from the Indian arm of Tecnimont SpA, an Italian engineering company, through an elaborate cyber fraud scheme that included impersonating the firm's chief executive, the Economic Times reports. The scammers sent emails requesting funds to the India head of Tecnimont, part of the publicly traded Maire Tecnimont, from an account that looked deceptively similar to one used by the Italian group's CEO, and also organized conference calls to discuss a ""Confidential"" acquisition in China, the ET report said. Defending against sophisticated BEC scams can be more difficult than spotting a phishing email, security experts note. According to the report in Economic Times, after sending emails to head of Indian subsidiary of the Milan-headquartered firm, hackers then arranged a series of conference calls to discuss a confidential acquisition in China. Tools such as DMARC, Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance, and SPF, Sender Policy Framework, only work when emails are sent from the same domain name. ""DMARC is a lot about business email compromise, spoofing of email etc, but it works only if hackers are spoofing on your domain. In such cases, SPF policies and DMARC will work and stop you from getting conned,"" says Shomiron Das Gupta, founder and CEO at Netmonastery, a SIEM security and event log management firm. In BEC attacks, the fake message often comes from a legitimate email account that an attacker has gained access to, either through social engineering or a targeted compromise."

Criminal:Magecart,"Hackers have breached the infrastructure of Volusion, a provider of cloud-hosted online stores, and are delivering malicious code that records and steals payment card details entered by users in online forms. The incident took place this week after hackers gained access to Volusion's Google Cloud infrastructure, where they modified a JavaScript file and included malicious code that logs card details entered in online forms. The incident is what cyber-security experts call a Magecart attack or web card skimming, where crooks steal payment card details from online shops, rather than ATMs. These types of hacks have been happening for years, but they've intensified over the past two. Most Magecart attacks take place when hackers use vulnerabilities in self-hosted stores to plant skimmer code on outdated online shops. Sometimes, hackers also manage to breach cloud-based platforms - like Volusion - or companies that provide widgets, analytics, ads, or other secondary services to online stores. Something like the latter case happened in May when hackers breached the cloud infrastructure for seven companies that provided services to online stores - namely Alpaca Forms, Picreel, AppLixir, RYVIU, OmniKick, eGain, and AdMaxim. The May incidents were traced to those companies' misconfigured cloud-hosting accounts, which allowed hackers to modify existing files without permission."

The database set-which contains 387,604 records with names, phone numbers, emails, home addresses and billing addresses-was open and visible in any browser for anyone to edit, download or even delete data without administrative credentials, according to Fowler. Data found in the files also included login credentials with hashed passwords for internal users as well as IP addresses, ports, pathways and storage info that could allow potential cybercriminals deeper access to other network resources, he said. The latter was the case earlier this month, when cosmetics giant Yves Rocher exposed the personal data of millions of its customers and reams of sensitive internal company information to the public because of an online server left unprotected by a third-party consultant to the firm.

""The downloaded script for mobile devices is a credit card skimmer which can steal the information entered on the hotel booking page and send it to a remote server."" Experts noticed that the link would deliver a credit card skimmer script only when users visited the websites using mobile devices, suggesting that the attackers aimed at targeting only mobile users. Although the module was only used for two websites of two different hotel chains, the number of potential victims is very high, as one of these brands has 107 hotels in 14 countries, while the other has 73 hotels in 14 countries. The software skimmer replaces the original credit card form on the booking page, in this way attackers could require customers to submit all credit card data, including the CVC number that is not required in some booking pages."

Magecart is an umbrella term given to different cybercriminal groups that are specialized in secretly implanting online credit card skimmers on compromised e-commerce websites with an intent to steal payment card details of their customers. These virtual credit card skimmers, also known as formjacking attack, are basically JavaScript code that hackers secretly insert into a compromised website, often on the shopping cart page, designed to capture payment information of customers in real-time and send it to a remote attacker-controlled server. The newly disclosed campaign doesn't belong to a single group of Magecart hackers; instead, researchers used a source code search engine to search for obfuscated JavaScript on the Internet with malicious patterns that were previously seen in the Magecart's virtual credit card skimmers. According to the researchers, the technique allowed them to quickly uncover more than 80 e-commerce websites compromised by Magecart groups, most of which were found running over outdated versions of Magento CMS that's vulnerable to an unauthenticated upload and remote code execution vulnerabilities. ""Many of the compromised sites are running version 1.5, 1.7, or 1.9. The arbitrary file upload, remote code execution, and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities all affect Magento version 2.1.6 and below. While it can't be stated authoritatively that this is what led to the breach of these sites, these are vulnerable versions of Magento that allow adversaries to inject the formjacking code into the site."" Though the researchers have not named the compromised companies in its report, they worked with federal law enforcement to notify all affected organizations as well as off-site servers prior to publishing their report.

Phone numbers have not been public in more than a year since Facebook restricted access to users' phone numbers. TechCrunch verified a number of records in the database by matching a known Facebook user's phone number against their listed Facebook ID. We also checked other records by matching phone numbers against Facebook's own password reset feature, which can be used to partially reveal a user's phone number linked to their account. This latest incident exposed millions of users' phone numbers just from their Facebook IDs, putting them at risk of spam calls and SIM-swapping attacks, which relies on tricking cell carriers into giving a person's phone number to an attacker.

This incident follows a previous security breach disclosed by Toyota in March that impacted roughly 3.1 million customers whose personal information may have been leaked following a security breach of multiple Toyota and Lexus sales subsidiaries. BEC fraud schemes are scam operations operated by fraudsters who attempt to deceive one or more employees of targeted organizations into wiring them money to bank accounts swapped with attacker-controlled ones. Some BEC victims recover some of the stolen funds by freezing them if they're not moved out of traceable accounts by the scammers, as it was the case with the Portland Public Schools which recovered roughly $2.9 million lost in a BEC attack during August. Others are not that fortunate, only having rescued some of the money lost, with the City of Saskatoon getting scammed out of $1.04 million and being in the process of recovering most of it, while Cabarrus County from North Carolina lost $1,728,082.

Hacktivist:Upguard,"What ties them together is that they both contain data about Facebook users, describing their interests, relationships, and interactions, that were available to third party developers. As Facebook faces scrutiny over its data stewardship practices, they have made efforts to reduce third party access. Data about Facebook users has been spread far beyond the bounds of what Facebook can control today. For app developers on Facebook, part of the platform's appeal is access to some slice of the data generated by and about Facebook users. The data exposed in each of these sets would not exist without Facebook, yet these data sets are no longer under Facebook's control. In each case, the Facebook platform facilitated the collection of data about individuals and its transfer to third parties, who became responsible for its security. The surface area for protecting the data of Facebook users is thus vast and heterogenous, and the responsibility for securing it lies with millions of app developers who have built on its platform."

Hacktivist,"Exclusive The maker of vehicle license plate readers used extensively by the US government and cities to identify and track citizens and immigrants has been hacked. Its internal files were pilfered, and are presently being offered for free on the dark web to download. Tennessee-based Perceptics prides itself as ""The sole provider of stationary LPRs installed at all land border crossing lanes for POV traffic in the United States, Canada, and for the most critical lanes in Mexico."" Perceptics recently announced, in a pact with Unisys Federal Systems, it had landed ""a key contract by US Customs and Border Protection to replace existing LPR technology, and to install Perceptics next generation License Plate Readers at 43 US Border Patrol check point lanes in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California."" On Thursday this week an individual using the pseudonym ""Boris Bullet-Dodger"" contacted The Register, alerting us to the hack, and provided a list of files exfiltrated from Perceptics' corporate network as proof. Many of the image files, we're guessing, are license plate captures. The stolen files amount to hundreds of gigabytes and include Microsoft Exchange and Access databases, ERP databases, HR records, Microsoft SQL Server data stores, and so on. With the CityComp hack, stolen files were released because a ransom was not paid; we have yet to determine whether a ransom was sought for the Perceptics files."
