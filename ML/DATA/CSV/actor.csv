Hacktivist,"A hacker has been able to send messages via text, email, and landline to tens of thousands of people across Australia after an emergency warning alert service, used by councils, was hacked. The message sent from the Early Warning Network on Friday night warned ""EWN has been hacked. Your personal data is not safe. Trying to fix the security issues"". EWN said a hacker accessed its alerting system and sent the message to part of its database. ""EWN staff at the time were able to quickly identify the attack and shut off our systems limiting the amount of messages sent out. Unfortunately, a small proportion of our database received this alert."" ""The actual data held in our system is just 'white pages' type data, we deliberately don't hold any other personal information."" The company said it's warning system remained fully operational during the breach and that it was working with the Queensland Police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre on the investigation. Mr Plowright said in the case of the NT, the EWN would usually be responsible for providing data to a number of ""Blue chip"" clients, including councils, regarding when and how a cyclone could hit."

Sincerely, Tamara Pattison Chief Marketing and Information Officer Information About Identity Theft Protection Review of Accounts and Credit Reports: You can regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. You should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page. You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national credit reporting agencies listed below."
Hacktivist,"Blind said that the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to ""a single server, one among many servers on our platform,"" according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email. Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members, but not the associated email addresses of each user. Blind claims on its website that its email verification ""Is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process."" It adds: ""This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can't do it."" Blind claims that the database ""Does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames,"" but we found did find streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. When other records didn't store an email address, the record contained the user's email as an unrecognized encrypted hash - which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else. Despite the company's apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens - the same kind of tokens that recently put Microsoft and Facebook accounts at risk. Some users sent anonymous, private messages in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails."

Bulletproof 360 Inc., purveyors of the fatty coffee touted as a wonder-treatment for mental clarity and weight loss, admitted that from May 20 to October 19 of this year - minus one day on October 14 - hackers slurped sensitive personal information hipsters entered when purchasing stuff online. ""In mid-October 2017, Bulletproof identified unauthorized computer code that had been added to the software that operates the checkout page at www.bulletproof.com,"" Bulletproof said in its mea culpa notification letter [PDF] to customers. Bulletproof said it is ""Working diligently"" to shore up its web systems after its security went to pot, and has vowed to prevent future similar attacks. As is usually the case with these sort of cockups, Bulletproof is advising its caffeine addicts to keep a close eye on their bank statements for any unauthorized charges brewing. The network security breach is particularly grinding for Bulletproof given its tech pedigree and the firm's particular appeal in Silicon Valley. Bulletproof got into the public spotlight on the back of endorsements from VC and startup execs in the tech world."

Criminal:FIN7,"Three high-ranking members of a sophisticated international cybercrime group operating out of Eastern Europe have been arrested and are currently in custody facing charges filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes for the Western District of Washington and Special Agent in Charge Jay S. Tabb Jr. of the FBI Seattle Field Office. According to three federal indictments unsealed today, Ukrainian nationals Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33, and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are members of a prolific hacking group widely known as FIN7. Since at least 2015, FIN7 members engaged in a highly sophisticated malware campaign targeting more than 100 U.S. companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. As set forth in indictments, FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers, which the group used or sold for profit. In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of companies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 15 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations. Each of the three FIN7 conspirators is charged with 26 felony counts alleging conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Hladyr allegedly served as FIN7's systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme."

Hacktivist,"You've probably never heard of the marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis. Earlier this month, security researcher Vinny Troia discovered that Exactis, a data broker based in Palm Coast, Florida, had exposed a database that contained close to 340 million individual records on a publicly accessible server. The haul comprises close to 2 terabytes of data that appears to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults, as well as millions of businesses. While the precise number of individuals included in the data isn't clear-and the leak doesn't seem to contain credit card information or Social Security numbers-it does go into minute detail for each individual listed, including phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, and other highly personal characteristics for every name. Exactis did not respond to multiple calls and emails from WIRED asking for comment on its data leak. Aside from the sheer breadth of the Exactis leak, it may be even more remarkable for its depth: Each record contains entries that go far beyond contact information and public records to include more than 400 variables on a vast range of specific characteristics: whether the person smokes, their religion, whether they have dogs or cats, and interests as varied as scuba diving and plus-size apparel. While the lack of financial information or Social Security numbers means the database isn't a straightforward tool for identity theft, the depth of personal info nonetheless could help scammers with other forms of social engineering, says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center."
Criminal,"The data was taken from FastBooking, a Paris-based company that sells hotel booking software to more than 4,000 hotels in 100 countries -as it claims on its website. In emails the company sent out to affected hotels today, FastBooking revealed the breach took place on June 14, when an attacker used a vulnerability in an application hosted on its server to install a malicious tool. According to FastBooking, the intruder stole information such as a hotel guests' first and last names, nationality, postal addresses, email addresses, and hotel booking-related information. The French company has sent emails to each affected hotel with details about the number of affected guests for each entity, and what type of data the attacker stole. Bleeping Computer has learned that FastBooking is also providing templates that each hotel can use to notify former guests of the breach, and templates to notify national data protection agencies about the leak of private guest data and their respective payment card details. The first hotel chain to inform customers of the FastBooking breach is Prince Hotels & Resorts in Japan. The hotel chain said the incident affected 124,963 guests who stayed at 82 of its hotels."
Hacktivist,"FedEx has exposed private information belonging to thousands of its customers after a legacy server was left open without a password. The data, hosted on a password-less Amazon S3 storage server, was secured Tuesday after efforts were made to contact FedEx. It's those unencrypted private customer records that were exposed on the server. The server contained more than 112,000 files, a mix of the completed US Postal Service forms used to authorize the handling of mail, along with identification. Among the exposed files, ZDNet confirmed drivers' licenses, national ID cards, and work ID cards, voting cards, and utility bills. We reached out to several individuals whose data was exposed by the password-less server, who confirmed their details and that they were either FedEx or Bongo customers. The server was secured within a few hours of ZDNet contacting FedEx."

Hammernutrition.com is now 100% secure and safe to use for credit card transactions."
Criminal:Magecart,"Malware capable of secretly recording payment card details was removed today from the Infowars online store after ZDNet reached out to the company's staff. The malware works by recording payment card details entered inside store checkout forms and then sending the data to remote servers. De Groot spotted the malware infection on the Infowars online store using a powerful malware scanner that he built a few years back and which is specialized in detecting vulnerabilities and infections in online stores built on top of the Magento e-commerce platform. This piece of code -also referred to as a card skimmer, or skimmer- was present on all Infowars store pages, but it only activated during the checkout process. The report, summarized in this ZDNet piece, presented the tactics and histories of seven different cyber-criminal operations that have deployed Magecart-like card skimming malware on online stores in the past four years. Albeit the Dutch researcher shared technical details on how the Infowars store was infected with the card skimmer, ZDNet will refrain from publishing such information to avoid putting future Infowars customers at unnecessary risk. Just yesterday, de Groot published research revealing that one in five online stores that suffered a Magecart infection were reinfected, at least once."

Hacktivist,"Bob Diachenko, Hacken.io's director of cyber risk research, earlier this month found the company's MongoDB database on a server, wide open and without a password. The server contained 21,612 records and climbing - representing weeks' worth of data, Diachenko told TechCrunch, prior to blogging his findings. The data included donor email addresses and donation receipts, which included customized links to a donor's tax receipt. It took Kars4Kids two days to pull the database offline after Diachenko warned of the data exposure, he said. Diachenko said that Kars4Kids had told him that customers had been informed, but TechCrunch has found no evidence of the company's claim. A note left in the database by a hacker claimed to have ""Downloaded and backed up;"" the hacker demanded bitcoin in exchange for the data's safe return. The breach represents a portion - though not all - of the cars that Kars4Kids receives annually - reportedly tens of thousands each year."
Criminal:Magecart,"Kitronik says a recent data breach impacting online shoppers and involving the potential theft of their financial data is the work of Magecart. The company says that Magecart's payment card-skimming malware was operating on the Kitronik website over the period of August to September, as reported by the Register. Customers of the BBC micro:bit vendor and electronics kit seller may have been impacted by the breach. In an email to customers, Kitronik co-founder Geoff Hampson said that the firm believes ""Only details entered at the checkout stage that might have been taken and as a result, customers that had set up an account prior to August would not have had their address details stolen."" Kitronik has pointed the finger at Magecart for the data breach. Magecart has been connected to attacks which directly inject JavaScript into vulnerable e-commerce platforms in order to embed malware, as well as the compromise of payment systems through third-party applications and widgets. In October, a security researcher uncovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Magento extensions which are being actively abused by Magecart to spread payment-skimming malware."
Criminal:SamSam,"The Justice Department has indicted two Iranian men behind the SamSam ransomware attacks - that infected the cities of Atlanta, San Diego and Newark, N.J. - as well as two others who converted the ransom into Iranian riyals. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, ""Extorted victims by leaving a ransom note in the form of a file on each computer encrypted by SamSam Ransomware,"" read the indictment, unsealed Wednesday a U.S. District Court in New Jersey. A SamSam attack crippled a number of systems and services in Atlanta in March and the Port of San Diego in September. The focus on healthcare may be due to the attacker's impression that these will be easier targets, they cybergang behind SamSam does show a preference for easy hits, or that they are more likely to fork over the ransom. Grammatical errors were a clue that the attackers likely didn't speak English as a first language, the attacks didn't rely on the typical badly worded spam email with an attachment. Once the attackers received the ransom, two Bitcoin exchangers, identified by the Treasury Department as Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, turned it into Iranian riyals. ""Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims. As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes,"" Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said in the release."
Criminal:Carbanak,"Hackers injected 15 lines of card skimming code on the online retailer's payments page which remained for more than a month between August 14 and September 18, Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at RiskIQ, told TechCrunch. The code siphoned off credit card data from unsuspecting customers to a server controlled by the hackers with a similar domain name - likely to avoid detection. In an email to customers, Newegg chief executive Danny Lee said the company has ""Not yet determined which customer accounts may have been affected."" When reached, a Newegg spokesperson did not immediately comment. Klijnsma called the incident ""Another well-disguised attack"" that looked near-identical to the recent British Airways credit card breach, and earlier, the Ticketmaster breach. Like that breach, RiskIQ attributed the Newegg credit card theft to the Magecart group, a collective of hackers that carry out targeted attacks against vulnerable websites. ""The breach of Newegg shows the true extent of Magecart operators' reach,"" said Klijnsma. Anyone who entered their credit card data during the period should immediately contact their banks."

Hacktivist,"Panerabread.com, the Web site for the American chain of bakery-cafe fast casual restaurants by the same name, leaked millions of customer records - including names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and the last four digits of the customer's credit card number - for at least eight months before it was yanked offline earlier today, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. The data available in plain text from Panera's site appeared to include records for any customer who has signed up for an account to order food online via panerabread.com. KrebsOnSecurity learned about the breach earlier today after being contacted by security researcher Dylan Houlihan, who said he initially notified Panera about customer data leaking from its Web site back on August 2, 2017. Some of the customer records include unique identifiers that increment by one for each new record, making it potentially simple for someone to scrape all available customer accounts. Another data point exposed in these records included the customer's Panera loyalty card number, which could potentially be abused by scammers to spend prepaid accounts or to otherwise siphon value from Panera customer loyalty accounts. It is not clear yet exactly how many Panera customer records may have been exposed by the company's leaky Web site, but incremental customer numbers indexed by the site suggest that number may be higher than seven million. Update, 8:40 p.m. ET: Almost minutes after this story was published, Panera gave a statement to Fox News downplaying the severity of this breach, stating that only 10,000 customer records were exposed."
Hacktivist,"As ElasticSearch based leaks become the latest source of massive data exposures, Sky Brasil, one of the biggest subscription television services in Brazil, is the latest to leave its customers exposed after not securing the server with a password. Independent researcher Fabio Castro found the firm exposed the data of 32 million subscribers in 28.7GB of log files and a 429.1GB of API data that revealed names, home addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, client IP address, payment methods, and encrypted passwords. ""The data the server stored was Full name, e-mail, password, pay-TV package data, client ip addresses, personal addresses, payment methods,"" Castro told BleepingComputer. NuData Security Vice President Ryan Wilk said the year has been a particularly bad year for news of the ""Non-breach 'breach'"" of sensitive user PII data. ""The unfortunate mishandling of trusted data by Sky Brasil, and before that Deep Root, data.gov.uk, and WWE continues to show that sophisticated hacking is not required to obtain troves of identity data that can be used to create fraudulent identities or access online personas,"" Wilk said. ""Understanding the user behind the device is key in effect devaluing the stolen identity data to any other person or entity,"" Wilk added. Earlier this week and ElasticSearch server exposed the data of nearly 57M U.S. residents and in another incident London-based Urban Massage app leaks data on 300K customers, including sexual misconduct claims."
Hacktivist,"TaskRabbit has a job for cybersecurity experts: find out what happened to their own network. The handyman-for-hire app, which connects workers with people who have a task they'd rather pay someone else to do, sent an alert to its users on Monday, informing them that they were ""Investigating a cybersecurity incident."" While TaskRabbit is conducting its investigation, the app and the website will temporarily be taken down, the email said. TaskRabbit did not specify how many people were affected by the incident, or what information was lost. ""We regret any inconvenience this may cause our clients and Taskers, and will reschedule any uncompleted tasks as soon as possible. For any Tasker who had a task scheduled today and is unable to complete the task, we will compensate them appropriately,"" a TaskRabbit representative said in an emailed statement. On Twitter, TaskRabbit users have sent complaints to the company, pointing out that TaskRabbit's website redirected them to a WordPress page showing the app's Github account. TaskRabbit responded to users on Twitter, writing that it's ""Aware of the technical issue and are on the case!""."
Criminal:BEC,"Hackers used phishing emails to break into a Virginia bank in two separate cyber intrusions over an eight-month period, making off with more than $2.4 million total. The email allowed the intruders to install malware on the victim's PC and to compromise a second computer at the bank that had access to the STAR Network, a system run by financial industry giant First Data that the bank uses to handle debit card transactions for customers. Just eight months later - in January 2017 according to the lawsuit - hackers broke in to the bank's systems once more, again gaining access to the financial institution's systems via a phishing email. Prior to executing the second heist, the hackers used the bank's Navigator system to fraudulently credit more than $2 million to various National Bank accounts. Verizon also told the bank that the malware the attackers used to gain their initial foothold at the bank in the 2017 breach was embedded in a booby-trapped Microsoft Word document. ""In its Coverage Determination, Everest further determined that the 2016 Intrusion and the 2017 Intrusion were a single event, and thus, pursuant to the Debit Card Rider, National Bank's total coverage under the Bond was $50,000.00 for both intrusions,"" the bank said in its lawsuit. On July 20 it filed a response to the bank's claims, alleging that National Bank has not accurately characterized the terms of its coverage or fully explained the basis for Everest's coverage decision."
