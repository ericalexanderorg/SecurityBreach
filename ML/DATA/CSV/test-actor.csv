?,"Miscreants gained access to US healthcare billing vendor AccuDoc Solutions' database for about a week in September, exposing the data of at least 2.65 million people. North Carolina-based Atrium Health, a customer of AccuDoc Solutions, this week said it had been affected by the breach. Atrium Health - which repeatedly emphasised its innocence - said AccuDoc had terminated unauthorised access as soon as the breach was identified, closed off the compromised path and rebuilt the affected database. In about 700,000 cases, it also included social security numbers, Atrium Health said - these people will be offered free identity monitoring services. AccuDoc provides billing services - such as preparing paper statements and operating a website for patients to pay for services - to various healthcare providers. The Charlotte Observer reported that Perkins had said ""Anything is possible"" when asked whether the breach might have affected more people. The Register has contacted AccuDoc for confirmation that the breach affected just these two customers."
?,"The Indiana Department of Insurance is investigating a recent data breach suffered by Bankers Life and Casualty Co., a division of Carmel-based insurance holding company CNO Financial Group Inc. Bankers Life and Casualty Co. disclosed late last week that it was hit by a data breach between May 30 and Sept. 13, and the hackers were able to gain extensive personal information for a ""Limited group"" of customers. Chicago-based Bankers Life sells financial products to middle-income clients, including Medicare supplement insurance, supplemental health insurance, life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuities. Bankers Life declined to disclose to IBJ details of how the outsiders gained access to employee information, nor would it disclose the number of customers whose personal information was accessed. In a statement released late last week, Bankers Life said that ""Unauthorized third parties"" gained access to a limited number of Bankers Life employees' credentials between May 30 and Sept. 13. In addition to the group whose data was accessed, Bankers Life said, a larger group of its customers may have had their information exposed; including names, addresses, birth dates, the last four digits of Social Security numbers and insurance information such as policy numbers, types of insurance, premiums, dates of service and claims amounts. On Thursday, the company said, it notified certain customers about the issue, including people who hold Medicare supplement policies through Colonial Penn Life Insurance Co., another CNO Financial unit. The Indiana Department of Insurance said consumers concerned about cybersecurity can get more information here."

?,"Unknown hackers have hijacked the DNS server for BlackWallet. The attack happened late Saturday afternoon, January 13, when the attackers hijacked the DNS entry of the BlackWallet. ""The DNS hijack of Blackwallet injected code,"" said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who analyzed the code before the BlackWallet team regained access over their domain and took down the site. The BlackWallet team and other XLM owners have tried to warn users via alerts on Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, the Stellar Community and GalacticTalk forums, but to no avail, as users continued to log into the rogue BlackWallet. BlackWallet admins are now desperately trying to catch Bittrex's attention to block the hackers' account. According to the BlackWallet admin, the incident took place after someone accessed his hosting provider account. ""Please note however that blackwallet was only an account viewer and that no keys were stored on the server!""."
?,"On Thursday, December 13th 2018, we became aware that some information about Blur users had been potentially exposed and immediately began working to ensure our systems and data were secure, to determine what happened, and to inform and help our users. Each user's last and second-to-last IP addresses used to login to Blur.Each user's encrypted Blur password. As a best practice, you should change your Blur password. If you use the same password you use on Blur on any other service, you should change those passwords to new unique passwords as well. To change your password, click ""Edit"" next to your password in your Blur Settings. You should also take this opportunity to ensure your new Blur password is long, but something you can remember, and that you have your Blur backup passphrase as well. You should use multi-factor authentication for your Blur account to add an extra layer of security to your account."
?,"According to a letter of warning sent out recently the Orange County, Calif., branch of the Girl Scouts experienced a data breach. The data breach, which is estimated to affect almost 3,000 members, occurred over the course of one day toward the end of September. An unknown third-party attacker was able to gain access to the email , which then allowed them to send numerous emails to various strategic locations. The data contained within these records include full legal birth names, home addresses, driver's license numbers, health history, and even insurance policy numbers. In the aftermath of the breach, the Girl Scouts of Orange County notified the attorney general in California of the incident. The letter also stated that the Girl Scouts went through their emails and deleted any that contained personal data. Finally, Christina Salcido stated that the Girl Scouts are beefing up their security by ""Implementing a secure online system for Troop Travel forms,"" as well as other undisclosed security hardening efforts being developed with their IT team."
?,"CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield on Wednesday said it had been hit with a data breach that compromised the personal information on approximately 1.1 million customers. As I noted in this Feb. 9, 2015 story, Anthem was breached not long after a malware campaign was erected that mimicked Anthem's domain names at the time of the breach. On Feb. 27, 2015, ThreatConnect published more information tying the same threat actors and modus operandi to a domain called ""Prennera[dot]com"". ""It is believed that the prennera[dot]com domain may have been impersonating the Healthcare provider Premera Blue Cross, where the attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the 'm' with two 'n' characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would be seen five months later with the we11point[dot]com command and control infrastructure,"" ThreatConnect observed in a February 2015 blog post. Turns out, the same bulk registrant in China that registered the phony Premera and Anthem domains in April 2014 also registered two Carefirst look-alike domains - careflrst[dot]com and caref1rst[dot]com. ThreatConnect has unearthed evidence showing the same tactics were used on EmpireB1ue.com, a domain registered April 11, 2014. EmpireBlue BlueCross BlueShield was one of the organizations impacted by the Anthem breach."
?,"US coffee store chain Caribou Coffee announced a security breach today after it discovered unauthorized access of its point of sale systems. All customers who used a credit or debit card at one of the affected stores between August 28, 2018, and December 3, 2018, should consider their card details compromised and take precautions such as asking for a card replacement, reviewing credit card reports, and enrolling in identity protection programs. Users can consult the list of impacted stores via the company's data breach notice, posted on its homepage. Caribou Coffee officials said they detected that something was wrong last month, on November 28, when its IT staff was alerted of ""Unusual activity"" on its network via its security monitoring processes. Two days later, Mandiant informed Caribou Coffee that it discovered unauthorized access of the company's POS system that also exposed some of the coffee store's customer data. Caribou Coffee said that names, card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes might have been exposed and collected by intruders. ""At this time, we are confident that the breach has been contained,"" said Caribou Coffee officials."
?,"Britain's data privacy watchdog has imposed one of its largest fines ever against retailer Carphone Warehouse over a massive data breach it suffered in 2015. The data breach of Carphone Warehouse affected its online division, which operates the OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk websites, and resulted in unauthorized access to the personal data of 3.3 million customers and 1,000 employees. ""A company as large, well-resourced and established as Carphone Warehouse should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks,"" U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham says. Because the ICO offers a 20 percent discount on fines that are paid within one month, it's expected that Carphone Warehouse will ultimately pay &pound320,000. While the ICO's breach report says there was ""No single root cause"" of the attack, it appeared to involve compromising a vulnerable WordPress installation that ""Was considerably out-of-date, exposed to the internet and suffered from multiple vulnerabilities."" Via WordPress, the attacker uploaded web shells that gave them file management and database access rights, the ICO says, at which point the attacker recovered credentials being stored in plaintext that led to the attacker accessing the databases that exposed customer data. The size of the fine against Carphone Warehouse equals the ICO's record fine for London-based telecommunications giant TalkTalk in October 2015. The Carphone Warehouse penalty comes just months before the EU begins enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation on May 25, 2018."
?,"CATAWBA COUNTY, NC - In Catawba County, letters are going out to more than 9,000 county employees, family members, and some retirees regarding a computer hack. Emails were sent to all county employees at that time to be on the lookout for identity theft issues. The county has sent out letters to 9,400 people advising them to be on the lookout for any issues that may come up. So far there is no evidence that any compromised information has been used by whoever hacked the system. They believe the hackers got into the system by sending emails to county employees and when someone opened up one of those emails, malware got into the system. Assistant County Manager Mary Furtado, who is among the 187 who had information stolen, is urging everyone to be vigilant against cyber thieves. County officials say the cyber breach has already cost the county $50,000 in deductible fees to the insurance company who is helping to pay for the experts who examined the system and for new cybersecurity efforts to shore up the computer system against hackers."
?,"The breach involved private user information, including phone numbers, dates of birth, frequent flier membership numbers and passport and government ID numbers, as well as information on passengers' past travels. The airline said that 27 credit card numbers - but not their corresponding security codes - had been obtained, as had 403 expired credit card numbers. The company said that no passwords were compromised, and that the breach would not affect flight operations or safety. The security breach has come at a tough time for the company, which counts the state-backed carrier Air China as a major shareholder. In an era when issues of data protection have come to the fore in Washington and other global capitals, the Cathay breach does not stand out for its scale. The airline said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that around 860,000 passport numbers and 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers had been exposed. Delta Air Lines said earlier this year that customer payment information had been exposed after a security breach at a company that provided online chat services for it."
?,"UPDATE: Coincheck has detailed its compensation policy for customers whose XEM was stolen. To recap: Coincheck confirmed Friday that the hack, now likely the largest ever in the space, occurred on its servers early afternoon local time in Tokyo. Neither Coincheck nor XEM are as systemically important as Gox and bitcoin were four years ago. Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, calculated that the Mt. Gox hack represented roughly 5 percent of all crypto assets' aggregate network value at the time. In contrast, the Coincheck theft represents less than 0.25 percent of the aggregate value, meaning ""The impact of the Mt. Gox hack was more than an order of magnitude greater on the crypto markets at the time,"" he said. Another difference is that the Coincheck customers have some hope of being repaid, whereas most of the bitcoins stolen from Gox were never recovered and its users were not made whole. During a press conference Friday, Coincheck executives indicated customers would be compensated for their stolen crypto, though it is unclear at this time whether they would be fully reimbursed."
?,"Cloud-based human resources company ComplyRight said this week that a security breach of its Web site may have jeopardized sensitive consumer information - including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and Social Security numbers - from tax forms submitted by the company's thousands of clients on behalf of employees. Pompano Beach, Fla-based ComplyRight began mailing breach notification letters to affected consumers late last week, but the form letters are extremely vague about the scope and cause of the breach. On Wednesday evening, ComplyRight posted additional facts about the incident on its site, saying a recently completed investigation suggests that fewer than 10 percent of individuals with tax forms prepared on the ComplyRight platform were impacted. ComplyRight includes information about its tax solutions division here and it appears that they also file Affordable Care Act and HIPAA paperwork. Again, neither ComplyRight nor its parent firm responded to multiple requests for comment. People who received a letter from ComplyRight may also file a Form 14039 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to help reduce the likelihood of becoming victims of tax refund fraud, an increasingly common scam in which fraudsters file a tax refund request with the IRS in your name and then pocket the refund money. Update, July 23, 8:00 a.m. ET: In a breach notice sent to Wisconsin's department of consumer protection, ComplyRight said its data breach affected 662,000 people."
?,"On October 4th, Pentagon officials were alerted to a data breach that affected its personnel. The data was accessed via a system that maintained travel records. Joseph Buccino downplayed the incident saying that only ""a very small percentage of the total population"" of employees were impacted. It's the nation's largest employer with 1.3 million enlisted men and women and another 742,000 civilian employees. The Department has not named the vendor that was victimized because its investigation is ongoing. This incident underscores the difficulties faced by large, complex organizations and businesses when it comes to securing data. It's hard enough to ensure in-house systems are properly secured."
?,"A data breach impacting employees of East Tennessee State University is still under investigation, CBS affiliate WJHL reports. University officials said that two employees clicked on a link in the phishing scam that was sent to their e-mail accounts. ETSU has been investigating and working to identify which staff members were affected and what information may have been exposed. Private information of 7,700 people could be exposed. ""On October 17, 2018 ETSU ITS discovered that an ETSU employee clicked on a phishing email that resulted in an unauthorized person accessing here email mailbox. Immediately upon discovery, ETSU ITS disabled the employee's email access , reset the employee's username and password and commenced an investigation...We are notifying you, because personal information about you and/or individuals in your family, household or otherwise, was contained in one of the employee's email mailbox.""

?,"The hacker setup a whole bunch of malicious servers. If someone's Electrum Wallet connected to one of those servers, and tried to send a BTC transaction, they would see an official-looking message telling them to update their Electrum Wallet, along with a scam URL. The hacker has already stolen 200 BTC, at this one address. ADVICE: Ignore any ""Update"" notifications in Electrum. I'm not 100% certain, but if you never downloaded the ""Update"", your wallet & funds should be ok. As for usage, I'd personally avoid using Electrum wallet for a few days, until the devs figure everything out."

?,"Forever 21 said Thursday it is tightening security efforts at its store cash wraps following its disclosure last month of a breach at some of its U.S. stores. Details of the security breach, which was first disclosed publicly by the company in November, did not include how many stores within the U.S. were impacted or in what states. Forever 21 does business in 57 countries via a fleet of more than 815 stores. Forever 21 confirmed the malware was able to access cardholder names in some instances but in most cases was only able to obtain card numbers, expirations and verification codes. The vulnerability in the system occurred between April 3 and Nov. 18 of this year with each store impacted by the breach subject to varying lengths of exposure ranging from days to the entire April-November period, Forever 21 said. The company's investigation also found some stores' authorized payment data logs could have also potentially been under attack by the malware. ""In addition to addressing encryption, Forever 21 is continuing to work with security firms to enhance its security measures,"" the company said in a statement Thursday."
?,"The attacker initially modified a DNS record for one particular server to point to a server in their possession and to intercept and forward the traffic to the original server that belongs to Fox-IT. This type of attack is called a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Sept 19 2017, 02:05-02:15 Maximum 10-minute time window during which the attacker temporarily rerouted and intercepted Fox-IT email for the specific purpose of proving that they owned our domain in the process of fraudulently registering an SSL certificate for our ClientPortal. Based on the outcome of our investigation, we understood the scope of the incident, we knew that the attack was fully countered and we were prepared to re-enable two factor authentication on ClientPortal in order to make it fully functional again. As mentioned, the attacker was able to redirect inbound traffic to ClientPortal and emails going to the fox-it.com domain for a short period of time. All our sensors do full packet capture and this is what allowed us to determine precisely, beyond any doubt, which information was intercepted by the attacker, the timeline of the event and who was affected by the attack. Once the attack was ongoing, we detected it reasonably quickly: within a few hours compared to the typical industry average of weeks before an attack is detected. We could, within a few hours of finding out about the attack, determine exactly who was affected and what the scope of the attacker was."
?,"Gentoo Developers & Infrastructure escalated to GitHub support and the Gentoo Organization was frozen by GitHub staff. The Gentoo Proxy Maintainers Project was impacted as many proxy-maint contributors use GitHub to submit PRs. All past pull requests were apparently disconnected from their original commits and closed. The main Gentoo repositories are kept on Gentoo hosted infrastructure and Gentoo mirrors to GitHub in order to ""Be where the contributors are.""

?,"On 27 June 2017, GoGet's IT team identified suspected unauthorised activity on its system and a full internal investigation was immediately commenced. Although the investigation by NSW Police is ongoing, it appears that the suspect was accessing GoGet's systems in an attempt to use GoGet vehicles without permission. In the process, as part of his overall activity on the system, it also appears that the suspect has accessed personal information of GoGet's members and individuals who have previously attempted to create a GoGet account. The personal information accessed by the suspect depends on what information was provided to GoGet by the individual when they became, or attempted to become, a member. NSW Police are also investigating whether the suspect was responsible for installing software onto GoGet's systems to access payment card details of a small group of individuals when they signed up to the service through GoGet's website or updated their payment card details. GoGet's number one focus has been to protect its members and any affected individuals and retrieve information potentially accessed by the suspect to prevent any misuse of that information. Has GoGet notified the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner?"
?,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a post buried on its website that the hackers obtained ""Inappropriate access"" to a number of broker and agent accounts, which ""Engaged in excessive searching"" of the government's healthcare marketplace systems. In a letter sent to affected customers this week, CMS disclosed that sensitive personal data - including partial Social Security numbers, immigration status and some tax information - may have been taken. Other information provided on the application, including expected income, tax filing status, family relationships, whether the applicant is a citizen or an immigrant, immigration document types and numbers, employer name, whether the applicant was pregnant, and whether the applicant already had health insurance;. Information provided by other federal agencies and data sources to confirm the information provided on the application, and whether the Marketplace asked the applicant for documents or explanations;. The government said that no bank account information - including credit card numbers, or diagnostic and treatment information - was taken. ""Not only can the attacker steal the identity of anyone in the breach, but they can also use this information to appear credible when crafting mobile spear-phishing messages against their targets."" ""This is especially true if the data that was leaked is accurate, as health information, family relationships and insurance information can make it extremely easy for an attacker to steal the identity of anyone affected by the breach,"" he said."
?,"A small number of HSBC online banking customers - less than 1% of accounts - were breached last month by unauthorized users, the bank acknowledged Tuesday. ""We responded to this incident by fortifying our log-on and authentication processes, and implemented additional layers of security for digital and mobile access to all personal and business banking accounts. We have notified those customers whose accounts may have experienced unauthorized access, and are offering them one year of credit monitoring and identify theft protection service."" ""We are reminding our customers to protect access to their banking accounts by regularly changing their passwords, and by using unique passwords they are not using elsewhere, including on any social media accounts,"" Sherman said. When it detected the breach, HSBC suspended online access for affected accounts and required impacted customers to contact it. In 2015, HSBC notified mortgage customers of a data breach that had taken place the year before. Personal information about mortgage accounts was ""Inadvertently made accessible via the Internet,"" including customers' names, Social Security numbers, account numbers, old account information and possibly some phone numbers, the bank said at that time. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation requires companies to disclose personal data breaches to regulators and affected customers within 72 hours of becoming aware of them."

?,"""Marriott learned during the investigation that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014,"" said the statement. The company said hat it obtained and decrypted the database on November 19 and ""Determined that the contents were from the Starwood guest reservation database."" Some 327 million records contained a guest's name, postal address, phone number, date of birth, gender, email address, passport number, Starwood's rewards information, arrival and departure information, reservation date, and their communication preferences. Starwood said an unknown number of records contained encrypted credit card data, but has ""Not been able to rule out"" that the components needed to decrypt the data wasn't also taken. Marriott-owned Starwood the largest hotel chain in the world, with more than 11 brands covering 1,200 properties, including W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element and more. Starwood branded timeshare properties are also included. The company has begun informing customers of the breach - including in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Given that the breach falls under the European-wide GDPR rules, Starwood may face significant financial penalties of up to four percent of its global annual revenue if found to be in breach of the rules."
?,"The majority of the reporting claimed that the point of compromise was due to a payment software called Click2Gov which was hosted on local servers. All three reports claimed that the point of compromise was the Click2Gov software. In the past 30 days, Gemini Advisory has identified over 12,283 compromised payment cards associated with the Click2Gov breach, of which approximately 4,000 cards are associated with previously unseen Topeka, KS and indicating that hackers still maintain the access to infiltrated systems. Gemini Advisory has provided all of the Click2Gov associated breach information to Federal Law Enforcement and is actively working to assist them in further investigation. Thus, Gemini Advisory suggests that users who are directed to pay through the Click2Gov system identify alternative means of making payments until the system threat has been eliminated. All local municipalities that utilize the Click2Gov software should confirm that the software is up-to-date and fully patched, and contact CentralSquare immediately if assistance is needed. Gemini Advisory is monitoring the development of the Click2Gov incident closely, and in the case that new victims are identified, all clients will be notified accordingly."
?,"A summary obtained by Hard Fork details 14 different attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges since January last year and calculates the state-sponsored Lazarus group is responsible for $571 million of the ill-gotten gains. Group-IB expects the number of targeted attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges to rise, and not just the ones from Lazarus. It warns the most aggressive hacker groups, usually known for attacking banks, will shift their attention to cryptocurrency exchanges now they know just how lucrative it can be. Fraudsters are even building fake websites using stolen cryptocurrency project descriptions and plagiarized whitepapers, disappearing with investor funds shortly after launching a fake ICO. 51-percent attacks are increasing. Group-IB predict attacks on ICOs will remain a threat for almost every project looking to attract investors. For 51-percent attacks to be successful, bad actors must control a majority of the total computing power utilized by a Proof-of-Work powered blockchain. ""In 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million,"" Group-IB reports."
?,"Between 11am until 1pm UTC today, DNS traffic - the phone book of the internet, routing you to your favourite websites - was hijacked by an unknown actor. The attackers used BGP - a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world - to reroute traffic to Amazon's Route 53 service, the largest commercial cloud provider who count major websites such as Twitter.com as customers. So far the only known website to have traffic redirected was to MyEtherWallet.com, a cryptocurrency website. The attacks only gained a relatively small amount of currency from MyEtherWallet.com - however their wallets in total already contained over £20m of currency. Mounting an attack of this scale requires access to BGP routers at major ISPs and real computing resource to deal with so much DNS traffic. The attackers failed to obtain an SSL certificate while man-in-the-middle attacking the traffic - a very easy process - which alerted people to the issue at scale. The security vulnerabilities in BGP and DNS are well known, and have been attacked before."
?,"We are writing to notify you about an issue that may involve your MyFitnessPal account information. On March 25, 2018, we became aware that during February of this year an unauthorized party acquired data associated with MyFitnessPal user accounts. The affected information included usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords - the majority with the hashing function called bcrypt used to secure passwords. We are working with leading data security firms to assist in our investigation. We are notifying MyFitnessPal users to provide information on how they can protect their data. We will be requiring MyFitnessPal users to change their passwords and urge users to do so immediately.

?,"If you've booked trips through Orbitz, hackers may have accessed your credit card or other payment card information in a recent attack. Reports from March 20, 2018, state that up to 880,000 payment card numbers and related information could've been exposed in a data breach. In the second disclosure, customer data from other travel sites that used Orbitz to book travel between Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 22, 2017, may have been compromised, according to published reports. The Orbitz breach is a reminder that it's good to regularly review credit card and bank statements, looking for unfamiliar transactions. Keep in mind that it can be safer to use credit cards instead of debit cards when making purchases. That's because debit cards give fraudsters direct access to the money in your checking account. With a credit card, your bank account isn't affected until you make a card payment."
?,"As you can see, during that time, we've made some major changes to the site, and though the design has changed substantially, we've made even more dramatic changes in the back-end. Our best guess is that someone was able to exploit a vulnerability in old, unmaintained code in the site's content management system, and made off with at least some user data, which may be as little as a few user records or, at worst, our entire database. To be perfectly honest, when contemplating what needed to be done to properly move the site to a new platform, I considered just throwing in the towel and going offline permanently. In order to keep your history from the old site, and to make that re-association process as painless as possible, we've written a very simple account migration tool. When you login to the new OSNews site, your password will be encrypted using a modern secure algorithm, which is currently PHP's password hash function, which uses Blowfish or Extended DES and can change over time so we don't repeat any past mistakes.

About 1.6 million utility customers nationwide who use the network were potentially affected by the breach. TIO PayPal notified the City Treasurer-Clerk's Revenue Division on Nov. 10 that TIO services were suspended until further notice because of a potential security breach of its nationwide network. Two days later, Nikolov explained in a follow-up email that PayPal had discovered network security vulnerabilities on the TIO platform and issues with TIO's data security program that did not adhere to PayPal's information security standards. The city posted a notice on its website in November about the suspension of the kiosk payment service and instructed customers to use alternate payment methods. TIO has operated kiosks at more than 40 locations in Tallahassee since 2008.TIO Networks USA President John Kunze followed up with letters dated Dec. 20 sent to customers notifying them ""With an abundance of caution"" that the investigation had uncovered unauthorized access to its network, and to personal information of customers of TIO's clients. ""The PayPal platform, which is separate from the TIO network, is not impacted by this situation in any way and PayPal's customers' data remains secure.""City Treasurer Jim Cooke said the vast majority of Tallahassee electric utility's 100,000-plus customers are not affected."

?,"Survey company Typeform has admitted suffering a breach caused by attackers downloading a ""Partial backup"" of its customer data. Each one of those collects data from possibly tens of thousands of their own customers when they take part, which widens the breach's scope. Each affected provider will therefore need to contact these customers independently - a situation that draws parallels with the breach suffered by email marketing provider Epsilon in 2011, which saw dozens of large brands sending out apology emails. Our initial investigations suggest that some personal data of about 20,000 people is likely to have been included in the breach. Typeform is vague about specifics, choosing to mention only what isn't at risk, namely subscription payment data, Typeform account passwords, any payments collected via Stripe integration, and audience payment data. Which brings us to the coalface of this breach - the unknown number of people who have never heard of Typeform, nor realised their data was being stored by them, but who might receive alert emails from the business that used it. If you're unlucky enough to be one of these, it seems the risk is, as stated, receiving phishing scams, that might use personal data from the breach to try to lure you in."

?,"LONDON - A recent attack aimed at a U.S.-based oil, gas and chemical supplier leverages the company's use of the enterprise-class Asterisk open-source PBX software, used for VoIP services. According to research from Check Point, presented here at Virus Bulletin 2019 on Friday, the attack was first identified early last year when researchers spotted scanning activity targeting 1,500 unique gateways tied to 600 companies. As a result, the adversary was able to gain complete control over the server, including being able to access databases, call recordings, metadata and detailed information on who called whom and when within the organization. The attacker injected a call file that caused the Asterisk server to make external calls and play canned messages with the identity of the victimized company. The PHP code hooked up with a command-and-control server, and downloaded a password-protected PHP web shell that carried out the data extraction, including the CALL file, which contains metadata on the calls made by the server. The attacker inserted a new CALL file into the outgoing directory, offering the ability to make outgoing calls under the guise of the victimized company. ""The infection vector is a customized PHP web shell, which is weaponized with new techniques targeting the Asterisk internal configuration files and databases - the same databases that hold all of the calls' metadata as well as the recordings of the calls,"" according to the paper."

In the last two days, McAlister's Deli, Moe's Southwest Grill, Schlotzsky's, and Hy-Vee disclosed publicly that their networks were infected with point-of-sale malware copying data from cards used in person at certain locations. Yesterday, the three Focus Brands subsidiaries provided details about a payment card security incident affecting corporate and franchised restaurants. As payment card data passed through a restaurant's server, the PoS malware copied from the card's magnetic stripe the card number, expiration date, and internal verification code; the cardholder's name was also available in some cases. Today's notification from Hy-Vee is an update for communication released on August 14 that informed customers of a payment data card incident discovered at an earlier date. In six locations there are suspicions that the start date for sweeping the card data was November 9, 2018. While PoS malware activity is far from its glory days, it continues to be good business as cards can sell for up to $35, depending on the brand, country, and amount of details they come with."

?,"Our first line of defense was to block the offending addresses, but ultimately we needed to enable captcha to stop the attack. After the attack was over, we diagnosed that 124 accounts had unauthorized access from the attack. It seemed like the attack focused on first validating which accounts were vulnerable, perhaps with a plan to later exploit these vulnerable accounts. Thankfully we were able to detect and stop the attack very quickly, and also ensure that any intruders were prevented further access. Protecting yourself against attacks like this is important. We've since beefed up our CAPTCHA protection across all applications and all clients, which has been effective at stopping the attack. CAPTCHA isn't perfect, and some times it's annoying, but it has provided effective protection against this wave of attack."

Whether UNICEF will be subject to a GDPR investigation is undetermined as of yet, with some experts thinking that UNICEF may avoid one as it's a United Nations organisation. Clare Sullivan, managing director of CyberSMART told Devex that UNICEF will probably be exempt from a GDPR probe as a UN body but it's something that still hasn't been tested in court. Mekki took a more absolute approach when addressing the question and said: ""UN entities are not subject to GDPR"" and that UNICEF did not report the case to authorities."

""The attack against ASCO has once again highlighted the dangerous power of ransomware. The attack has brought operations to a halt and resulted in over a thousand employees being sent home which will be having a significant impact on the organisation financially,"" Andrea Carcano, CPO and co-founder of Nozomi Networks, told SecurityWeek. Several important organizations have been hit by ransomware over the past year, including Eurofins Scientific, COSCO, Norsk Hydro, the UK Police Federation, and Aebi Schmidt."

All three universities - Graceland University, Oregon State University, and Missouri Southern State University - have notified the individuals whose personal information was potentially stolen or accessed about the security incidents. No evidence has been found of the impacted personal information being stolen or used in a malicious manner while investigating the disclosed data privacy incidents involving all three universities. Graceland University says in a notice of data breach published on June 14 that an ""Unauthorized user gained access to the email accounts of current employees,"" on March 29, 2019, as well as ""From April 1-30 and April 12-May 1, 2019, respectively."" As the university discovered during the breach investigation, ""The personal information of some people who had interacted with these email accounts over the past several years was available during the time the unauthorized user(s) had access."" Oregon State University states in a press release that ""636 student records and family records of students containing personally identifiable information were potentially affected by a data privacy incident that occurred in early May."". Missouri Southern State University, the third entity which reported a breach, states in a notice of data breach sent to the Office of the Vermont Attorney General that it was alerted of a possible cyber attack triggered by a phishing email on January 9."
?,"A Florida-based ad agency has left a database open on the internet that leaked details about past advertising campaigns, including information regarding medical malpractice cases, and sensitive details about combat injuries sustained by US military veterans. The database, discovered by security researchers from vpnMentor, belonged to X Social Media, an ad company that runs Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns for the legal industry. Data contained in these forms usually included full names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, and details related to their cases - mostly focused on medical injuries. ""The injuries described in the database vary from combat injuries suffered by American veterans to injuries caused by medical devices, pesticide use, medication side-effects, and defective baby products,"" the vpnMentor said in a report published this week. The details about combat injuries not only included information such as the date and place where the injury occurred, but also detailed medical information and mental trauma the person suffered in the aftermath; details that many applications wouldn't want made public. On top of this highly sensitive information relating to various injuries and legal cases, the X Social Media database also contained information about all the company's clients, ad campaign metrics, and even all the company's invoices. The ad agency closed access to its database on June 11, nine days after vpnMentor found the server and notified the company."
?,"Imperva, one of the leading cybersecurity startups that helps businesses protect critical data and applications from cyberattacks, has suffered a data breach that has exposed sensitive information for some of its customers, the company revealed today. The security breach particularly affects customers of Imperva's Cloud Web Application Firewall product, formerly known as Incapsula, a security-focused CDN service known for its DDoS mitigation and web application security features that protect websites from malicious activities. In a blog post published today, Imperva CEO Chris Hylen revealed that the company learned about the incident on August 20, 2019, only after someone informed it about the data exposure that ""Impacts a subset of customers of its Cloud WAF product who had accounts through September 15, 2017."". The exposed data includes email addresses and hashed and salted passwords for all Cloud WAF customers who registered before 15th September 2017, as well as API keys and customer-provided SSL certificates for a subset of users. ""We have informed the appropriate global regulatory agencies. We have engaged outside forensic experts."" The company has not yet revealed how the Cloud WAF customers' data got leaked, whether its servers were compromised or if it was accidentally left unsecured in a misconfigured database on the Internet. Imperva is still investigating the incident, and the company has ensured that it is informing all impacted customers directly and is also taking additional measures to scale up its security. Cloud WAF users are recommended to change their account passwords, implement Single Sign-On, enable two-factor authentication, generate and upload new SSL certificate, and reset their API keys."
?,"PerCSoft, a Wisconsin-based company that manages a remote data backup service relied upon by hundreds of dental offices across the country, is struggling to restore access to client systems after falling victim to a ransomware attack. West Allis, Wis.-based PerCSoft is a cloud management provider for Digital Dental Record, which operates an online data backup service called DDS Safe that archives medical records, charts, insurance documents and other personal information for various dental offices across the United States. The ransomware attack hit PerCSoft on the morning of Monday, Aug. 26, and encrypted dental records for some - but not all - of the practices that rely on DDS Safe. Director of communications for the Wisconsin Dental Association, said the ransomware encrypted files for approximate 400 dental practices, and that somewhere between 80-100 of those clients have now had their files restored. Some affected dental offices have reported that the decryptor did not work to unlock at least some of the files encrypted by the ransomware. Cloud data and backup services are a prime target of cybercriminals who deploy ransomware. In July, attackers hit QuickBooks cloud hosting firm iNSYNQ, holding data hostage for many of the company's clients."
?,"XKCD-one of the most popular webcomic platforms known for its geeky tech humor and other science-laden comic strips on romance, sarcasm, math, and language-has suffered a data breach exposing data of its forum users. At the time of writing, XKCD has taken down its forum and posted a short notice on its homepage, as shared below, urging its users to change their passwords immediately. ""The xkcd forums are currently offline. We've been alerted that portions of the PHPBB user table from our forums showed up in a leaked data collection. The data includes usernames, email addresses, salted, hashed passwords, and in some cases, an IP address from the time of registration."" ""We've taken the forums offline until we can go over them and make sure they're secure. If you're an echochamber.me/xkcd forums user, you should immediately change your password for any other accounts on which you used the same or a similar password."" The forum administrators are also notifying affected users via email. As mentioned, XKCD uses phpBB, a free and open-source forum and bulletin board software built in the PHP programming software. At this moment it's unclear if XKCD was using an older version of the forum software vulnerable to a security flaw or the attackers exploited any previously undiscovered flaw in phpBB to extract the data unauthorisedly. Even if XKCD was running over phpBB version 3.1 and later, which uses more secure BCRYPT hashing algorithm, it's possible that the passwords for early users of the XKCD forum were encrypted via the older, less secure MD5 hashing method. What you can do now: affected users are strongly advised to immediately change their XKCD password, as well as passwords for any other online accounts which re-use the same password."
?,"Poshmark, an online marketplace where North American users can buy and sell new or used clothes, shoes, and accessories, disclosed a data breach yesterday, on August 1. The company said that an unauthorized party gained access to its servers from where it stole information such as usernames, hashed passwords, first and last names, gender information, and city of residence. The hacker also stole clothing size preferences, user emails, and social media profile information collected when users connected social media accounts to Poshmark, the company said. The hacker also got their hands on some less important information, such as some internal Poshmark account preferences, used by the company to send email and browser and mobile push notifications. Poshmark did not reveal when the breach occurred or when the company found out about it. In a blog post and a security notice posted on its website, the online marketplace said it contracted a security vendor following the discovery of the breach, and that a security audit performed by this vendor did not reveal ""Any material vulnerabilities"" that the hacker might have exploited. Last year, fashion retailer SHEIN announced a similar security breach during which a hacker stole the details of 6.42 million users."
?,"Twitter today finally decided to temporarily disable a feature, called 'Tweeting via SMS,' after it was abused by a hacking group to compromise Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey last week and sent a series of racist and offensive tweets to Dorsey's followers. Dorsey's Twitter account was compromised last week when a hacker group calling itself ""Chuckling Squad"" replicated a mobile phone number associated with the CEO account and abused this particular feature to post racist, offensive messages and bomb threats from it via SMS. Replicating a mobile phone number associated with someone else is a technique known as ""SIM swapping,"" where attackers social engineer a victim's mobile phone provider and trick the telecom company to transfer target's phone number to their own SIM card. Once they social engineered an AT&T employee and gained access to Dorsey's phone number, the Chuckling Squad hackers used the 'Tweeting via SMS' feature to post tweets under his username, even without actually logging in to his account. For those unaware, Twitter has a feature that gives its users the ability to post a tweet from their account just by sending an SMS message to the company number from their registered mobile number associated with their Twitter account. Twitter says the phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider, allowing an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number pic. The feature still exists and has been misused several times in the past since no authentication is required other than just having access to the linked phone number. In a series of tweets published today, Twitter says it has temporarily disabled this feature and working on improving it by exploring options to offer an authenticated way."

Monster.com which learned of the breach in August, did not initially alert potential victims to the exposure, contending that notification responsibly lay with the recruitment company that ""Owned"" the data. ""Customers that purchase access to Monster's data - candidate résumés and CVs - become the owners of the data and are responsible for maintaining its security,"" Monster Chief Privacy Officer Michael Jones said in a statement cited by TechCrunch. ""In today's era of growing privacy regulations, how companies react in the wake of a data breach is critical, said Peter Goldstein, CTO and co-founder of Valimail."" ""Monster might have paid careful attention to their internal security practices, but still the data that they are responsible for has been exposed,"" said Pankaj Parekh, chief product and strategy officer at SecurityFirst. ""The exposed resumes give cybercriminals more than enough data to commit phishing attacks and effective impersonation attempts, which can lead to account takeover, identity theft and other scams,"" said Goldstein.

?,"Updated Citrix today warned its customers that foreign hackers romped through its internal company network and stole corporate secrets. According to infosec firm Resecurity, which had earlier alerted the Feds and Citrix to the cyber-intrusion, at least six terabytes of sensitive internal files were swiped from the US corporation by the Iranian-backed IRIDIUM hacker gang. ""Based our recent analysis, the threat actors leveraged a combination of tools, techniques and procedures, allowing them to conduct targeted network intrusion to access at least six terabytes of sensitive data stored in the Citrix enterprise network, including email correspondence, files in network shares, and other services used for project management and procurement."" Citrix said it took action - launching an internal probe and securing its networks - after hearing from the FBI earlier this week. Earlier today, Citrix chief information security officer Stan Black gave his company's side of the story. As a massive provider of remote management, networking, and videoconferencing products, Citrix has an extremely large portfolio spread across a number of sectors in the enterprise IT market. For now, Citrix said it is planning to cooperate fully with the FBI probe, and has also brought in an outside security firm to help investigate the intrusion and make sure that hackers will not be able to get back in to the network."
?,"What ties them together is that they both contain data about Facebook users, describing their interests, relationships, and interactions, that were available to third party developers. As Facebook faces scrutiny over its data stewardship practices, they have made efforts to reduce third party access. Data about Facebook users has been spread far beyond the bounds of what Facebook can control today. For app developers on Facebook, part of the platform's appeal is access to some slice of the data generated by and about Facebook users. The data exposed in each of these sets would not exist without Facebook, yet these data sets are no longer under Facebook's control. In each case, the Facebook platform facilitated the collection of data about individuals and its transfer to third parties, who became responsible for its security. The surface area for protecting the data of Facebook users is thus vast and heterogenous, and the responsibility for securing it lies with millions of app developers who have built on its platform."

Change your password now - no plaintext Matrix passwords were leaked, but weak passwords could still be cracked from the hashed passwords. Change your NickServ password - there's no evidence bridge credentials were compromised, but if you have given the IRC bridges credentials to your NickServ account we would recommend changing this password. The attacker did have access to the production database, so unencrypted content may be compromised. We weighed the risk of some users losing access to encrypted messages against that of all users' accounts being vulnerable to hijack via the compromised access tokens.

?,"One bad search on the government website for South Carolina's capital city could've exposed an entire database. The city of Columbia site had a security flaw in its search tool, according to independent security researcher Arif Khan. The flaw let anyone view passwords for the website's database and email protocol servers, creating a massive potential for abuse, Khan said on Thursday. The vulnerability made it possible for someone to ""Pull sensitive data out of the Columbia city government's database,"" Khan said. With access to the email protocol servers, an attacker could've also created spoof emails that looked like they'd come from the city government. He reached out again in October, he said, and another security researcher also publicly contacted the city government in November on Twitter. Cybercriminals often target city governments because they serve an important function and have access to sensitive information."

From the information collected this far, the attack appears to be ""An extremely sophisticated attempt,"" says Jaya Baloo, Avast Chief Information Security Officer. The intruder connected from a public IP address in the U.K. and took advantage of a temporary VPN profile that should no longer have been active and was not protected with two-factor authentication. Suspecting CCleaner as the targeted asset, Avast on September 25 stopped the upcoming updates for the software and started to check prior releases for malicious modification. The old certificate was revoked, says in a statement today Jaya Baloo, Avast Chief Information Security Officer. The company tracked the intruder by keeping the VPN profile active and monitoring the access going through it until mitigation actions could be deployed."
?,"Business-to-business payments provider Billtrust is still recovering from a ransomware attack that began last week. With more than 550 employees, Lawrence Township, N.J.-based Billtrust is a cloud-based service that lets customers view invoices, pay, or request bills via email or fax. In an email sent to customers today, Billtrust said it was consulting with law enforcement officials and with an outside security firm to determine the extent of the breach. In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity on Monday evening, Billtrust CEO Steven Pinado said the company became aware of a malware intrusion on Thursday, Oct. 17. A report from BleepingComputer cites an unnamed source saying the ransomware strain that hit Billtrust was the BitPaymer ransomware, but that information could not be confirmed. He declined to discuss anything related to the ransomware attack, such as whether the company paid a ransom demand in exchange for a key to unlock files scrambled by the malware, although he allowed Billtrust does have cybersecurity insurance for just such occasions. Billtrust recently teamed up with Visa to launch the Billtrust Business Payments Network, an effort to digitize payments between businesses."
?,"Security researchers have discovered a cryptojacking worm that propagates using containers in the Docker Engine and has spread to more than 2,000 vulnerable Docker hosts. ""The attacker compromised an unsecured Docker daemon, ran the malicious Docker container pulled from Docker Hub, downloaded a few scripts and a list of vulnerable hosts from C2 and repeatedly picked the next target to spread the worm,"" Palo Alto Networks's Unit 42 researchers explained. ""If my host is compromised, the malicious container does not start immediately. Instead, I have to wait until another compromised host picks me and starts my mining process. Other compromised hosts can also randomly stop my mining process. Essentially, the miner on every infected host is randomly controlled by all other infected hosts."" Sending the number of available CPUs on the compromised host to the C2. Downloading a file that contains a list of 2000+ IPs, randomly picking one as the next target and pulling and deploying a malicious Docker image that contains a docker client tool that is used to communicate with other Docker hosts remotely. Picking one of the compromised hosts from the list and pulling and deploying a Docker image that contains a cryptojacking binary on the host. The two malicious Docker images have been downloaded more than 16,500 times, but have since been removed from Docker Hub, along with another cryptojacking image by the same user. ""While this cryptojacking worm doesn't involve sophisticated tactics, techniques, or procedures, the worm can periodically pull new scripts from the C2s, so it can easily repurpose itself to ransomware or any malware to fully compromise the hosts down the line and shouldn't be ignored. If a more potent worm is ever created to take a similar infiltration approach, it could cause much greater damage, so it's imperative for organizations to safeguard their Docker hosts,"" they noted."
?,"The City of Baltimore was hit with a ransomware attack in May of this year. City council members alleged a lack of transparency and communication in the wake of the incident, as well as an inability to maintain a functional organization ""During an emergency event."" He also also never drafted a continuity of operations plan for an IT attack of the kind that occurred. Given the fact that $6 million has already been pulled from parks and public utilities funds to ""Harden"" city systems, the $76,000 demand now seems like a bargain. This understatement brought the hearing to a halt as council members expressed their disbelief that city data was not being backed up. City data needed for an audit cannot be recovered because the IT department never made an effort to express the dangers of storing the only copy of data locally. Ars has requested information from the city regarding the contracting details for the recovery, but the city has thus far provided no data. The city figures it will cost $18 million to recover from a rejected $76,000 ransom demand."
?,"For what seems like the umpteenth time this year, a big company has found itself struggling after a ransomware attack. The victim this time is US mailing services company, Pitney Bowes, which made an announcement to explain why a range of its services had been disrupted. Currently, some of those services might be down, the company said, including SendPro products, postage refill, 'Your Account' access, and the 'Supplies' web store. We don't know which ransomware is involved, nor when the affected systems might return. In a separate ransomware incident, French media company Groupe M6 was hit by an attack at the weekend that took down servers and phone lines. Although the company appears to have suffered only mild disruption, at least one other company, TV station TF1, tweeted that it had stopped email communication with Groupe M6 for fear of the infection spreading. Only days before that, US company Alphabroder was hit by Sodinokibi, a derivative of the GandCrab ransomware."

?,"The Krystal Company would like to advise guests that our company is actively investigating a security incident that involves one of the payment processing systems that services some of our restaurants. Although our investigation is in its early stages, we have learned that the security incident may have involved payment cards processed by a payment processing system used at certain restaurants between July through September 2019. Krystal uses multiple payment processing systems and, as a result, not all Krystal restaurants have been impacted by this incident. Krystal will provide updates to guests once we have completed our investigation and know more about payment cards that may have been impacted. Krystal is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers and will continue to take quick action. Krystal is working hard to determine the specific locations and dates for each restaurant involved in the attack. If you do not see a specific restaurant location when searching this tool, that restaurant has not been identified as potentially impacted."
