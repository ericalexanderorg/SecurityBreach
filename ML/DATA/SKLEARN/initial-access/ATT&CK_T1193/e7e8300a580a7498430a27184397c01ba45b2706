Analysis of attack data alone is misleading, due to Black Vine's attack vectors.

Page 7 The Black Vine cyberespionage group Attackers' resources Black Vine appears to have access to a wide variety of resources to let it conduct multiple simultaneous attacks over a sustained period of time. Who is behind Black Vine? We analyzed the group's infrastructure, resources, and attack patterns in order to find out who the Black Vine attackers could be and what their motivations are. The primary difference between the attacks was that the Sakurel payload was delivered in the Capstone attack while Bifrose was distributed in the CFR attack. In a number of attacks, the malware has been delivered onto the victim's computer after Black Vine has exploited a zero-day vulnerability primarily through watering-hole attacks.
