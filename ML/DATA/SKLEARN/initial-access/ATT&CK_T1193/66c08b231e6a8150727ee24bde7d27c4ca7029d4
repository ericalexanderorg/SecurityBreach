The hacker setup a whole bunch of malicious servers. If someone's Electrum Wallet connected to one of those servers, and tried to send a BTC transaction, they would see an official-looking message telling them to update their Electrum Wallet, along with a scam URL. The hacker has already stolen 200 BTC, at this one address. ADVICE: Ignore any "Update" notifications in Electrum. I'm not 100% certain, but if you never downloaded the "Update", your wallet & funds should be ok. As for usage, I'd personally avoid using Electrum wallet for a few days, until the devs figure everything out.
