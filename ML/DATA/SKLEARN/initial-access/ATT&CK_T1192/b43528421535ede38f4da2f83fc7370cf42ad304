The hackers behind a "Massive and coordinated" attack on the campaign of France's president-elect, Emmanuel Macron, have been linked by a number of cybersecurity research firms to the Russian-affiliated group blamed for attacking the Democratic party shortly before the US election. New York's Flashpoint and Tokyo-based Trend Micro have shared intelligence that suggests that the hacking group known variously as Advanced Persistent Threat 28, Fancy Bear and Pawn Storm was responsible. A congratulatory statement from the Kremlin, which had been widely seen as backing Le Pen, urged Macron to work with Russia to "Overcome mutual mistrust and unite to ensure international stability and security". Despite the strong technical abilities believed to be possessed by APT 28, its primary route of attack is a simple yet effective method known as spear phishing: creating fake login pages targeted at individuals in an attempt to encourage them to enter their usernames and passwords, giving the hackers access to confidential information. Another factor may have been the response of the Macron campaignIt intervened an hour before the legally imposed blackout on public statements from election candidates to report that many of the documents being shared were fake. The Daily Beast claimed that rather than being faked by the hackers or those reposting the data, the bogus information had been planted by the Macron campaign, which had become aware it was the target of a phishing campaign and flooded the hackers with false information. The Macron campaign reportedly turned the spear phishing strategy against the attackers, by flooding "These addresses with multiple passwords and logins, true ones, false ones, so the people behind them use up a lot of time trying to figure them out", according to Mahjoubi.
