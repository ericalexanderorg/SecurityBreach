Beaumont Health, a network of eight hospitals through the Detroit area, said in a letter Friday that "An unauthorized third party" accessed names, birth dates, Social Security numbers and medical conditions about some 112,000 people. Hackers also accessed bank account data and driver's license numbers about some of those affected, the Detroit Free Press first reported. Administrators noticed on March 29 that email accounts belonging to Beaumont employees apparently had been compromised following a phishing attack. Outsiders had spent May 23, 2019 through June 3, 2019 accessing personal data, though Beaumont now says it has no knowledge to suggest that the stolen data was misused. The incident involves information about less than 5% of the 2.3 million people that the medical organization has treated in the nearly 12 months since the attack occurred, according to Beaumont. The attack against the hospital network occurred months before U.S. facilities started responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this Story- Beaumont Health, data breach, health care.
