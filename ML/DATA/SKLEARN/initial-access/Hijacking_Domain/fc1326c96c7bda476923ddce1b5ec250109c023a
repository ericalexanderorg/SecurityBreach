The attacker initially modified a DNS record for one particular server to point to a server in their possession and to intercept and forward the traffic to the original server that belongs to Fox-IT. This type of attack is called a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Sept 19 2017, 02:05-02:15 Maximum 10-minute time window during which the attacker temporarily rerouted and intercepted Fox-IT email for the specific purpose of proving that they owned our domain in the process of fraudulently registering an SSL certificate for our ClientPortal. Based on the outcome of our investigation, we understood the scope of the incident, we knew that the attack was fully countered and we were prepared to re-enable two factor authentication on ClientPortal in order to make it fully functional again. As mentioned, the attacker was able to redirect inbound traffic to ClientPortal and emails going to the fox-it.com domain for a short period of time. All our sensors do full packet capture and this is what allowed us to determine precisely, beyond any doubt, which information was intercepted by the attacker, the timeline of the event and who was affected by the attack. Once the attack was ongoing, we detected it reasonably quickly: within a few hours compared to the typical industry average of weeks before an attack is detected. We could, within a few hours of finding out about the attack, determine exactly who was affected and what the scope of the attacker was.
