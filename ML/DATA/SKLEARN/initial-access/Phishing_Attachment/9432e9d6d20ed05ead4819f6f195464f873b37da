CWT, a giant in the corporate travel agency world with a global clientele, may have faced payment of $4.5 million to unknown hackers in the wake of a ransomware attack. A CWT spokesperson declined to comment on whether the ransom was paid, or any technical details of the attack, or how it was able to recover so quickly. Despite assurances of recovery, the impact of the incident could be wide: CWT says that it provides travel services to 33 percent of the Fortune 500 and countless smaller companies. The attackers behind the Ragnar Locker ransomware in particular are known for stealing data before encrypting networks, as was the case in April, in an attack on the North American network of Energias de Portugal. "Mirroring the 'name and shame' tactic used by Maze Group ransomware, victim's data is exfiltrated prior to encryption and used to leverage ransomware payments. The bullying tactics used by these ransomware groups are making attacks even more expensive, and they are not going to stop any time soon, particularly within the current climate." If a data breach occurred in the CWT incident, the company has made no public disclosure on that aspect of the incident, and it has not yet reported the issue to the California Department of Justice. According to the Register, certain CWT clients confirmed that they were notified of the incident by the travel agency.
