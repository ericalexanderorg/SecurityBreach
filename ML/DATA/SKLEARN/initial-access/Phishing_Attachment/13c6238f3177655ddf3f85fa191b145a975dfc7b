A summary obtained by Hard Fork details 14 different attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges since January last year and calculates the state-sponsored Lazarus group is responsible for $571 million of the ill-gotten gains. Group-IB expects the number of targeted attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges to rise, and not just the ones from Lazarus. It warns the most aggressive hacker groups, usually known for attacking banks, will shift their attention to cryptocurrency exchanges now they know just how lucrative it can be. Fraudsters are even building fake websites using stolen cryptocurrency project descriptions and plagiarized whitepapers, disappearing with investor funds shortly after launching a fake ICO. 51-percent attacks are increasing. Group-IB predict attacks on ICOs will remain a threat for almost every project looking to attract investors. For 51-percent attacks to be successful, bad actors must control a majority of the total computing power utilized by a Proof-of-Work powered blockchain. "In 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million," Group-IB reports.
