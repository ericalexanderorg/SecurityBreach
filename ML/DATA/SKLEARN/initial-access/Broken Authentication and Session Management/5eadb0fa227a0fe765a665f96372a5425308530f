On Tuesday, we discovered that an attacker exploited a technical vulnerability to steal access tokens that would allow them to log into about 50 million people's accounts on Facebook. We invalidated the access tokens for the accounts of the 50 million people who were affected - causing them to be logged out. These people will have to log back in to access their accounts again. We do not currently have any evidence that suggests these accounts have been compromised, but we're taking this step as a precautionary measure. We face constant attacks from people who want to take over accounts or steal information around the world. While I'm glad we found this, fixed the vulnerability, and secured the accounts that may be at risk, the reality is we need to continue developing new tools to prevent this from happening in the first place.
