The intrusion originated on May 5 when a build deployed to the development tier for stackoverflow.com contained a bug, which allowed an attacker to log in to our development tier as well as escalate their access on the production version of stackoverflow.com. On May 11, the intruder made a change to our system to grant themselves a privileged access on production. This change was quickly identified and we revoked their access network-wide, began investigating the intrusion, and began taking steps to remediate the intrusion. As part of our security procedures to protect sensitive customer data, we maintain separate infrastructure and networks for clients of our Teams, Business, and Enterprise products and we have found no evidence that those systems or customer data were accessed. Our team has taken, and continues to take, a number of steps as part of our response to this incident, including: Terminating the unauthorized access to the system. Remediating the original issues that allowed the unauthorized access and escalation, as well as any other potential vectors that we have found during the investigation. Taking precautionary measures such as cycling secrets, resetting company passwords, and evaluating systems and security levels.
