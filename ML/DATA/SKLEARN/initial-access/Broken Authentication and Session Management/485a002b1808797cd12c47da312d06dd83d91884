A Florida-based ad agency has left a database open on the internet that leaked details about past advertising campaigns, including information regarding medical malpractice cases, and sensitive details about combat injuries sustained by US military veterans. The database, discovered by security researchers from vpnMentor, belonged to X Social Media, an ad company that runs Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns for the legal industry. Data contained in these forms usually included full names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, and details related to their cases - mostly focused on medical injuries. "The injuries described in the database vary from combat injuries suffered by American veterans to injuries caused by medical devices, pesticide use, medication side-effects, and defective baby products," the vpnMentor said in a report published this week. The details about combat injuries not only included information such as the date and place where the injury occurred, but also detailed medical information and mental trauma the person suffered in the aftermath; details that many applications wouldn't want made public. On top of this highly sensitive information relating to various injuries and legal cases, the X Social Media database also contained information about all the company's clients, ad campaign metrics, and even all the company's invoices. The ad agency closed access to its database on June 11, nine days after vpnMentor found the server and notified the company.
