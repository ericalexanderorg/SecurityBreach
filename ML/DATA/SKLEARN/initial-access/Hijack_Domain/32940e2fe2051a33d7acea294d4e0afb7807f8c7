Unknown hackers have hijacked the DNS server for BlackWallet. The attack happened late Saturday afternoon, January 13, when the attackers hijacked the DNS entry of the BlackWallet. "The DNS hijack of Blackwallet injected code," said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who analyzed the code before the BlackWallet team regained access over their domain and took down the site. The BlackWallet team and other XLM owners have tried to warn users via alerts on Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, the Stellar Community and GalacticTalk forums, but to no avail, as users continued to log into the rogue BlackWallet. BlackWallet admins are now desperately trying to catch Bittrex's attention to block the hackers' account. According to the BlackWallet admin, the incident took place after someone accessed his hosting provider account. "Please note however that blackwallet was only an account viewer and that no keys were stored on the server!".
