Security experts describe a real attack case that sees the attackers using a small, unidentified hardware device to hack into the target network. Is it possible to hack into a network using a sort of invisibility cloak? In addition to the certificate, the network access profile and envelope were authentic and valid, meaning that none of the existing security and monitoring tools recognized it as a rogue device. The attackers were using a "Ghost" malicious device that was acting in the shadow of the legitimate one. Besides its other modus operandi, the device supports a virtual cable mode whereby two devices can be paired, and each installed at different locations while operating as if they are interconnected using a standard passive LAN cable. These devices do not have an IP or MAC address meaning that Intrusion Detection Systems, Network Access Control and Network Monitoring tools are unable to detect them - hence the "Invisibility" cloak. Stolen data can be leaked through local storage or an out-of-band communication channel without being detected by current network security tools such as IDS and NAC. "What one can do?
