According to a report from the US Office of the Inspector General, someone connected an unauthorized Raspberry Pi to a JPL network, giving hackers a way into the systems. The comprehensive federal review of JPL's systems stemmed from an April 2018 incident when someone at JPL attached the Raspberry Pi to the network there for an unknown purpose. It was apparently quite simple for the unknown attackers to get into the systems attached to the same network as the Raspberry Pi. While inside JPL's network, the hackers reportedly stole about 500MB of data related to human spaceflight. After ransacking the JPL computers, the attackers found a route deeper into JPL's network. The security breach was so severe that officials at Johnson Space Center decided to disconnect from the JPL network to protect projects like the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and International Space Station. The OIG lambasts JPL for the shared nature of its network. The system JPL uses to track network hardware is apparently woefully incomplete and poorly maintained.
