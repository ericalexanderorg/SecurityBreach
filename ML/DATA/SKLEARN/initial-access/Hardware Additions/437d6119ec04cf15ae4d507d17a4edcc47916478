Among the new tools is one called USBCulprit, which appears designed for use in air-gapped environments where systems are not directly accessible from an external network. According to Kasperksy, its analysis shows the malware is a capable of stealing targeted data from an infected system and passing it on to connected USB drives. The malware is programmed to copy itself selectively to certain USB drives so it can move laterally to other air-gapped systems each time an infected USB drive is inserted into one. Kaspersky has been unable to find any evidence of how these specially marked systems then exfiltrate the stolen data. The malware collects documents based on file extensions and where the documents are located on the system - for example, Desktop, Recent Document, and other directories. The malware doesn't appear to be distinguishing files based on actual content, so there is no way of identifying the nature of documents that Cyclkdek might be fetching from air-gapped systems in government organizations. The infrastructure being used and the behaviors on infected systems by each of them are different, Kaspersky says.
