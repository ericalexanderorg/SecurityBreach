Finastra, a company that provides a range of technology solutions to banks worldwide, said it was shutting down key systems in response to a security breach discovered Friday morning. The company's public statement and notice to customers does not mention the cause of the outage, but their response so far is straight out of the playbook for dealing with ransomware attacks. "We wish to inform our valued customers that we are investigating a potential security breach. At 3:00 a.m. EST on March 20, 2020, we were alerted to anomalous activity on our network which risked the integrity of our data-centers," reads the notice. "The Finastra risk and security services team has detected anomalous activity on our systems," wrote Tom Kilroy, Finastra's chief operating officer. That's because some of the more active ransomware gangs have taken to downloading reams of data from targets before launching the ransomware inside their systems. One reader on Twitter told KrebsOnSecurity they'd heard Finastra had sent thousands of employees home today as a result of the security breach, but that claim could not be confirmed. Interestingly, several ransomware gangs have apparently stated that they are observing a kind of moratorium on attacking hospitals and other healthcare centers while the Coronavirus epidemic rages on.
