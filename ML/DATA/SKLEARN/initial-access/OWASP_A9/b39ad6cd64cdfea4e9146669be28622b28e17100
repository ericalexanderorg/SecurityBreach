China-linked cyber espionage group APT20 has been bypassing two-factor authentication in recent attacks, cyber-security firm Fox-IT warns. Security experts from cyber-security firm Fox-IT warns of a new wave of attacks, tracked as Operation Wocao, carried out by China-linked cyber espionage group APT20 that has been bypassing 2FA. The attacks aimed at government entities and managed service providers that were active in many industries, including aviation, healthcare, finance, insurance, energy, and gambling. The APT20 group has been active since at least 2011, but experts did not associate any campaign with this threat actors between 2016 and 2017. "Operation Wocao is the name that Fox-IT uses to describe the hacking activities of a Chinese based hacking group." reads the report published by Fox-IT. "In several cases the initial access point into a victim network was a vulnerable webserver, often versions of JBoss. Such vulnerable servers were observed to often already be compromised with webshells, placed there by other threat actors. The actor actually leverages these other webshells for reconnaissance and initial lateral movement activity." According to the experts, the threat actor has been able to stay under the radar even using simple tools and techniques for their hacking campaigns. They speculated that the APT20 group stole an RSA SecurID software token from a compromised system, then used it on its systems to generate valid one-time codes and bypass 2FA. "An interesting observation in one of Fox-IT's incident response cases was that the actor steals a softtoken for RSA SecurID, which is typically generated on a separate device, such as a hardware token or mobile phone." continues the report. Anyway, the software token must be generated for a specific system, the threat actors were able to do it by retrieving information once inside the target network.
