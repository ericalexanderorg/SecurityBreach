Dutch police on Friday arrested a 19-year-old man from Breda suspected of launching a distributed denial of service attack on a government website. Nl is a guide for information and services from all government organizations in the Netherlands. During a DDoS attack, the targeted website is overwhelmed with traffic in an effort to make it inaccessible to legitimate users. Given the current coronavirus crisis, when emergency ordinances and regulations are made accessible through this site, the Dutch police notes, keeping it accessible is vital. An investigation into the incident was carried out by the cybercrime team of the Dutch police in Utrecht, led by a public prosecutor from The Hague. "By taking a website like this offline, you are denying citizens access to their personal data and important government information. We take this very high, especially now that the corona crisis is causing additional uncertainty and a great need for information by many people. We want to protect people and companies and make it increasingly difficult for cyber criminals to carry out a DDoS attack," said Jeroen Niessen of the cybercrime team of the Central Netherlands Police. The Central Netherlands Police - in cooperation with Europol, Interpol, the FBI, other police forces, and external parties - shut down 15 so-called booters.
