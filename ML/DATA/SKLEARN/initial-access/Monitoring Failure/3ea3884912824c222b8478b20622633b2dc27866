If you find any suspicious activity on your credit reports, call your local police or sheriff's office, and file a police report for identity theft and get a copy of it. Sincerely, Tamara Pattison Chief Marketing and Information Officer Information About Identity Theft Protection Review of Accounts and Credit Reports: You can regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. You should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page. You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national credit reporting agencies listed below.
