We already know by now Coinomi is cheap and they went farther this time and hired a company by the name of CipherBlade to "Launder" their mess. In their report, CipherBlade has concluded that my funds were stolen because my machine probably had malware and it had nothing to do with Coinomi's "Spell Check" hidden feature that sent my seed/passphrase to a third-party in clear text. CipherBlade kept repeating that they are unbiased and they don't favor Coinomi's side over me, but in reality they ignored many facts and tried to mislead the community as Coinomi did. CipherBlade kept implying multiple times in their report that I should report the incident to law enforcement agencies as theft rather than filing a legal case against Coinomi. Ironically, CipherBlade claims that they are a cyber-security firm and yet they did not acknowledge even once in their report that the "Spell Check" bug was a CRITICAL vulnerability. In CipherBlade's case, the full report was focusing on claiming negative arguments against me and acknowledging positive points towards Coinomi with just assumptions. CipherBlade has violated my privacy by publishing my personal crypto-currency wallet addresses without my consent.
