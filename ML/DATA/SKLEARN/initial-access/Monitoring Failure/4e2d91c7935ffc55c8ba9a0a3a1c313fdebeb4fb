Logo ... How Bulletproof Coffee markets itself on its website. Bulletproof 360 Inc., purveyors of the fatty coffee touted as a wonder-treatment for mental clarity and weight loss, admitted that from May 20 to October 19 of this year - minus one day on October 14 - hackers slurped sensitive personal information hipsters entered when purchasing stuff online. "In mid-October 2017, Bulletproof identified unauthorized computer code that had been added to the software that operates the checkout page at www.bulletproof.com," Bulletproof said in its mea culpa notification letter [PDF] to customers. Bulletproof said it is "Working diligently" to shore up its web systems after its security went to pot, and has vowed to prevent future similar attacks. As is usually the case with these sort of cockups, Bulletproof is advising its caffeine addicts to keep a close eye on their bank statements for any unauthorized charges brewing. The network security breach is particularly grinding for Bulletproof given its tech pedigree and the firm's particular appeal in Silicon Valley. Bulletproof got into the public spotlight on the back of endorsements from VC and startup execs in the tech world.
