On 22 Feb 2019 we were contacted by Warith Al Maawali via our Support Helpdesk regarding a security vulnerability in our Desktop wallets. The report said that seed phrases were being sent over to Google in plain text due to a built-in spell-check functionality in Desktop wallets and that there was a wallet hacked due to this vulnerability. The seed phrase wasn't being transmitted at all unless the user chose to explicitly restore their Desktop wallets. If you are using Coinomi Desktops and you created a new wallet with your Desktop, again there's no further action required other than updating your client to the latest version. If you are using Coinomi Desktops and you restored an existing wallet into your Desktop wallet we recommend that you create a new wallet and move your funds there after you update your client to the latest version. We've had zero reports of hacked Desktop wallets so far other than Warith Al Maawali's, which however cannot be sustained by the underlying facts - there is still way to investigate the authenticity of his claim and if the funds were indeed stolen it was much more likely due to an infected host rather than Google itself stealing these funds. To sum things up: was there an issue with our Desktop wallets? Yes, there was, and it was fixed hours only after it was disclosed to us.
