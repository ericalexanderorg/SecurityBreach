Live Nation Entertainment subsidiary Ticketmaster has admitted it has suffered a serious data breach affecting 40,000 of its British and international customers. Anyone who used the Ticketmaster UK, GETMEIN! and TicketWeb sites to book tickets from February 2018 and 23 June 2018 may have had data compromised, including their name, email address, physical address, telephone number, Ticketmaster logins, and payment card details. On Thursday 12th April , members of the Ticketmaster security team visited the Monzo office so we could share the information we'd gathered. On Saturday, June 23, 2018, Ticketmaster UK identified malicious software on a customer support product hosted by Inbenta Technologies, an external third-party supplier to Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster may end up with questions from the UK Information Commissioner's Office about the apparent delay in telling its customers. What to do? If you're one of the 40,000 account holders that Ticketmaster says was affected by the compromise, you should have received an email telling you to change your account password. Replace your payment cards as soon as you can if you're on the list of Ticketmaster customers known to have been affected.
