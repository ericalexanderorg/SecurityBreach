Malware capable of secretly recording payment card details was removed today from the Infowars online store after ZDNet reached out to the company's staff. The malware works by recording payment card details entered inside store checkout forms and then sending the data to remote servers. De Groot spotted the malware infection on the Infowars online store using a powerful malware scanner that he built a few years back and which is specialized in detecting vulnerabilities and infections in online stores built on top of the Magento e-commerce platform. This piece of code -also referred to as a card skimmer, or skimmer- was present on all Infowars store pages, but it only activated during the checkout process. The report, summarized in this ZDNet piece, presented the tactics and histories of seven different cyber-criminal operations that have deployed Magecart-like card skimming malware on online stores in the past four years. Albeit the Dutch researcher shared technical details on how the Infowars store was infected with the card skimmer, ZDNet will refrain from publishing such information to avoid putting future Infowars customers at unnecessary risk. Just yesterday, de Groot published research revealing that one in five online stores that suffered a Magecart infection were reinfected, at least once.
