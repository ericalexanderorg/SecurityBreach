Update: Hardware wallet Ledger's CEO Eric LarchevÃªque comments, "The Coinomi meltdown is further evidence of why software wallets are a recipe for disaster. When entrusting a software wallet with your assets, you are exposing your private keys to the internet, leaving them vulnerable to attack." Coinomi has responded to the allegations in this post on Medium which states the spell checking functionality was enabled for desktop wallets but that the seed phrase wasn't sent as plain text, it was "Encapsulated inside a HTTPS request with Google being the sole recipient." It added that Google did not process, cache or store the requests. A report by security consultant Warith Al Maawali claims he lost $60,000 to $70,000 while using the Coinomi wallet. Al Maawali told Decrypt he used his Ethereum seed phrase in the Coinomi wallet to access Ethereum-based tokens that he owned but were not supported by the Exodus crypto wallet which he was already using. Due to this, he did some research and found what he believes is a critical vulnerability within the Coinomi wallet. There have been other reports of funds disappearing on the Coinomi wallet-which isn't uncommon for any software wallet. There are two posts on Reddit by users who claim their funds have disappeared from the Coinomi wallet.
