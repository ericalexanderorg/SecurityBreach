Britain's data privacy watchdog has imposed one of its largest fines ever against retailer Carphone Warehouse over a massive data breach it suffered in 2015. The data breach of Carphone Warehouse affected its online division, which operates the OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk websites, and resulted in unauthorized access to the personal data of 3.3 million customers and 1,000 employees. "A company as large, well-resourced and established as Carphone Warehouse should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks," U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham says. Because the ICO offers a 20 percent discount on fines that are paid within one month, it's expected that Carphone Warehouse will ultimately pay &pound320,000. While the ICO's breach report says there was "No single root cause" of the attack, it appeared to involve compromising a vulnerable WordPress installation that "Was considerably out-of-date, exposed to the internet and suffered from multiple vulnerabilities." Via WordPress, the attacker uploaded web shells that gave them file management and database access rights, the ICO says, at which point the attacker recovered credentials being stored in plaintext that led to the attacker accessing the databases that exposed customer data. The size of the fine against Carphone Warehouse equals the ICO's record fine for London-based telecommunications giant TalkTalk in October 2015. The Carphone Warehouse penalty comes just months before the EU begins enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation on May 25, 2018.
