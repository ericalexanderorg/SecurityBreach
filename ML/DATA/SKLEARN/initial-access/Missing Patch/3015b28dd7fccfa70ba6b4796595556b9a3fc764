Customers seeking to grab a deal on top-end shoe brands this Christmas have been warned to avoid sites that promise heavily discounted prices as they risk being hit by a highly effective credit card scam. The tactic is now being used against sites that claim to promote goods from highly collectable brands such as Nike, Adidas and Converse, in some cases offering shoes worth over $1,000 for as little as $100 - all of which are counterfeit. All affected sites were found to be loading a JavaScript file on their checkout page, a skimming script called translate. Some 288 sites have been identified, many of which are still in operation. We were able to access one such site and locate the Magecart script in action. Investigations into several of the domains also revealed that they were all using the same outdated software, namely version 1.9.4.2 of Magento, and version 5.6.40 of PHP, suggesting that hackers simply used a scanner to crawl through the IP ranges and used the same vulnerability on each site. The company also warned users to avoid sites that look like they haven't been updated in a while, particularly as many of these sites still display notes such as "Copyright 2015".
