Foreign exchange company Travelex is facing demands for payment to decrypt critical computer files after it was hit by one of the most sophisticated ransomware attacks, known as Sodinokibi, which disabled its IT systems on New Year's Eve. According to security specialists, criminals are expected to demand a six-figure sum to supply Travelex with decryption tools that will allow it to recover the contents of files across its computer network that have been encrypted by the virus. The disclosure comes amid new evidence that Travelex took eight months to patch computer servers containing a critical security vulnerability after the problem was first disclosed by security researchers, leaving its networks vulnerable to attacks from cyber criminals. The attack resulted in the Travelex websites in at least 20 countries becoming inaccessible and left its outlets in airports and other retail sites without access to the internet or email or Travelex's IT systems, as the company shut down systems to prevent the spread of the virus. The attack has also disrupted banks, including Sainsbury's Bank, Barclays, HSBC, Virgin Money, First Direct and Asda Money, along with others that rely on Travelex to provide their foreign exchange services. Customers have complained they have been unable to top up their Travelex currency cards, confirm transactions have taken place, check balances or use the Travelex app. Computer Weekly has established that Travelex had waited for eight months to patch critical security weaknesses in the Pulse Secure VPN servers it uses to provide employees remote internet access to its central computers, leaving the company's networks vulnerable to access by cyber criminals.
