UK-based financial technology company Finastra is investigating a cybersecurity incident that may involve a piece of ransomware infecting some of its systems. Cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs reported that the company suffered a security breach that led to the disruption of some services. Finastra has not shared any details about the attack. "Earlier, Finastra teams learned of potentially anomalous activity on our systems. Upon learning of the situation, we engaged an independent, leading forensic firm to assist us in investigating the scope of the incident. Out of an abundance of caution, we immediately acted to take a number of our servers offline while we continue to investigate," Tom Kilroy, chief operating officer at Finastra, said in a statement. Bad Packets pointed out after the news broke that Finastra last year hosted vulnerable Pulse Secure servers. Bad Packets also pointed out that at least until January 11, 2020, Finastra had four Citrix servers that were vulnerable to attacks due to an actively exploited security hole disclosed late last year. Researcher Kevin Beaumont noted that if the attackers targeted the Pulse Secure VPN, the company may have been hit by REvil ransomware.
