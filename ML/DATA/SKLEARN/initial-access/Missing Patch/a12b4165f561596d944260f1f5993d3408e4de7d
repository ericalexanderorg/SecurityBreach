The UN did not publicly disclose a major hacking attack into its IT systems in Europe - a decision that potentially put staff, other organisations, and individuals at risk, according to data protection advocates. No matter what exactly was exposed, the decision not to notify all the people or organisations whose data may have been compromised - including UN staff - risks damaging trust in the UN as an institution, and so its effectiveness, according to human rights and privacy analysts. The breach affected dozens of servers in three separate locations: the UN Office at Vienna; the UN Office at Geneva; and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights headquarters in Geneva. The senior UN IT official said much more data was stolen than the UN implied. The report, prepared by the UN Office at Geneva in the midst of containment efforts, suggests the cyber attack most seriously affected their office, which houses 1,600 staff working in a range of political and development units, including Syria peace talks, the humanitarian coordination office, and the Economic Commission for Europe. A spokesperson for OHCHR said via email: "OHCHR faces regular cyber attack attempts, and we are constantly monitoring to safeguard the integrity of our computer systems and the data they hold." Under its IT czar, Atefeh Riazi, the UN has slimmed the numbers of data centres, websites, and applications it runs, updating email, security, and other infrastructure.
