FedEx has exposed private information belonging to thousands of its customers after a legacy server was left open without a password. The data, hosted on a password-less Amazon S3 storage server, was secured Tuesday after efforts were made to contact FedEx. It's those unencrypted private customer records that were exposed on the server. The server contained more than 112,000 files, a mix of the completed US Postal Service forms used to authorize the handling of mail, along with identification. Among the exposed files, ZDNet confirmed drivers' licenses, national ID cards, and work ID cards, voting cards, and utility bills. We reached out to several individuals whose data was exposed by the password-less server, who confirmed their details and that they were either FedEx or Bongo customers. The server was secured within a few hours of ZDNet contacting FedEx.
