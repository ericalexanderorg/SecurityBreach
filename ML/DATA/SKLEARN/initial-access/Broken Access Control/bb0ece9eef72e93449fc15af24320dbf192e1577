Bob Diachenko, Hacken.io's director of cyber risk research, earlier this month found the company's MongoDB database on a server, wide open and without a password. The server contained 21,612 records and climbing - representing weeks' worth of data, Diachenko told TechCrunch, prior to blogging his findings. The data included donor email addresses and donation receipts, which included customized links to a donor's tax receipt. It took Kars4Kids two days to pull the database offline after Diachenko warned of the data exposure, he said. Diachenko said that Kars4Kids had told him that customers had been informed, but TechCrunch has found no evidence of the company's claim. A note left in the database by a hacker claimed to have "Downloaded and backed up;" the hacker demanded bitcoin in exchange for the data's safe return. The breach represents a portion - though not all - of the cars that Kars4Kids receives annually - reportedly tens of thousands each year.
