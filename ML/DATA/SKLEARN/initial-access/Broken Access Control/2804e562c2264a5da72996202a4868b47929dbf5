A hacking forum this week published details of more than 10.6 million guests who stayed at MGM Resorts on a hacking forum, the result of a breach due to unauthorized access to a cloud server that occurred at the famous Las Vegas hotel and casino last summer. Personal details found on the forum included full names, home addresses, phone numbers, emails and dates of birth for 10,683,188 guests who had previously stayed at the MGM Resorts, according to the report. ZDNet worked with a security researcher at Under the Breach, a soon-to-be-launched data-breach monitoring service, to confirm the authenticity of the data on the forum, and then reached out to MGM Resorts and some of the people affected by the breach for further confirmation. MGM almost immediately confirmed the breach to ZDNet, linking it to a security incident that happened last summer, according to the report. "Last summer, we discovered unauthorized access to a cloud server that contained a limited amount of information for certain previous guests of MGM Resorts," MGM said, according to the report. MGM alerted all guests who were affected at the time, something that also appeared to be true in a comment made in August on a site called VegasMessageBoard by a community member who said he'd been notified that his data had been stolen at MGM Resorts in July. Though the breach happened last summer, the guest details-which included personal info for celebrities as diverse as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and pop music star Justin Bieber - were mostly out of date, MGM officials said.
