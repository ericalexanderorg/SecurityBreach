Mossab Hussein, chief security officer at Dubai-based cybersecurity firm SpiderSilk, found the repository storing Clearview's source code. Clearview claims it only allows law enforcement to use its technology, but reports show that the startup courted users from private businesses like Macy's, Walmart and the NBA. But this latest security lapse is likely to invite greater scrutiny of the company's security and privacy practices. "We have set up a bug bounty program with HackerOne whereby computer security researchers can be rewarded for finding flaws in Clearview AI's systems," said Ton-That. "SpiderSilk, a firm that was not a part of our bug bounty program, found a flaw in Clearview AI and reached out to us. This flaw did not expose any personally identifiable information, search history or biometric identifiers," he said. Hussein, who has previously reported security issues at several startups, including MoviePass, Remine and Blind, said he reported the exposure to Clearview but declined to accept a bounty, which he said if signed would have barred him from publicly disclosing the security lapse. In February, Clearview admitted to customers that a list of its customers was stolen in a data breach - though, it claimed its servers were "Never accessed." Clearview also left unprotected several of its cloud storage buckets containing its Android app. Several tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, have already filed cease-and-desist letters with Clearview AI. In an interview with CBS News in February, Ton-That defended his company's practices.
