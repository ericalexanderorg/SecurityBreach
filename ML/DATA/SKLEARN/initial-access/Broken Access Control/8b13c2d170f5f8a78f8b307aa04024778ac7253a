Blind said that the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to "a single server, one among many servers on our platform," according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email. Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members, but not the associated email addresses of each user. Blind claims on its website that its email verification "Is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process." It adds: "This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can't do it." Blind claims that the database "Does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames," but we found did find streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. When other records didn't store an email address, the record contained the user's email as an unrecognized encrypted hash - which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else. Despite the company's apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens - the same kind of tokens that recently put Microsoft and Facebook accounts at risk. Some users sent anonymous, private messages in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails.
