Exclusive Tesco has shuttered its parking validation web app after The Register uncovered tens of millions of unsecured ANPR images sitting in a Microsoft Azure blob. The images consisted of photos of cars taken as they entered and left 19 Tesco car parks spread across Britain. Tesco admitted to The Register that "Tens of millions" of timestamped images were stored on it, adding that the images had been left exposed after a data migration exercise. Tesco customers across the nation were instructed to use parkshopreg.co.uk to validate their parking with a code printed on their receipts along with their vehicle's registration number, thus avoiding parking charges. Live ANPR images were saved to the blob as timestamped jpegs with the time information also contained within the image filenames, allowing anyone with access to harvest the images in bulk for illicit use. The web app compared the store-generated code with the ANPR images to decide whom to issue with parking charges. A Tesco spokesman told The Register: "A technical issue with a parking app meant that for a short period historic images and times of cars entering and exiting our car parks were accessible. Whilst no images of people, nor any sensitive data were available, any security breach is unacceptable and we have now disabled the app as we work with our service provider to ensure it doesn't happen again."
