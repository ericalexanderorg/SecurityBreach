The United Nations' children's agency UNICEF has leaked thousands of individuals' personal data through its online learning portal Agora. Agora offers courses on child rights, humanitarian action, data, research and is used by UNICEF staff and members of the public. UNICEF became aware fi the incident a day after the email was sent and remedied the situation to "Prevent such an incident from reoccurring". Agora users were sent an email explaining the situation which then asked them to delete the spreadsheet full of data they may have received from their inboxes and their recycle bins too. Whether UNICEF will be subject to a GDPR investigation is undetermined as of yet, with some experts thinking that UNICEF may avoid one as it's a United Nations organisation. Clare Sullivan, managing director of CyberSMART told Devex that UNICEF will probably be exempt from a GDPR probe as a UN body but it's something that still hasn't been tested in court. Mekki took a more absolute approach when addressing the question and said: "UN entities are not subject to GDPR" and that UNICEF did not report the case to authorities.
