A widely used hotel reservation platform has exposed 10 million files related to guests at various hotels around the world, thanks to a misconfigured Amazon Web Services S3 bucket. Many of the records contain data for multiple hotel guests that were grouped together on a single reservation; thus, the number of people exposed is likely well over the 10 million, researchers said. "The company was storing years of credit-card data from hotel guests and travel agents without any protection in place, putting millions of people at risk of fraud and online attacks," according to the firm, in a recent notice on the issue. "The S3 bucket contained over 180,000 records from August 2020 alone. Many of them related to hotel reservations being made on numerous websites, despite global hotel bookings being at an all-time low for this period." The records contain a raft of information, Website Planet said, including full names, email addresses, national ID numbers and phone numbers of hotel guests; card numbers, cardholder names, CVVs and expiration dates; and reservation details, such as the total cost of hotel reservations, reservation number, dates of a stay, special requests made by guests, number of people, guest names and more. Hotel guests affected could be the targets of a wide range of attacks, from identity theft and phishing to someone hijacking their vacations, researchers said.
