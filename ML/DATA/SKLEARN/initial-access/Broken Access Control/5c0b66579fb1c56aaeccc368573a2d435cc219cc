Santander Consumer Bank, the Belgian branch of the bank, had a misconfiguration in its blog domain that was allowing its files to be indexed. Our analysts found that the Belgian branch, Santander Consumer Bank, has a misconfiguration in its blog domain, allowing its files to be indexed. When we looked through these files, we were able to see sensitive information, including an SQL dump and JSON file that can be used by hackers to potentially phish Santander's bank customers. We contacted Santander immediately when we discovered the misconfiguration on April 15. Representatives from the leading European bank responded to our emails and seem to have fixed the issue, as we are presently unable to access the information. "The incident highlighted relates specifically to the Santander Consumer Bank Belgium blog only. The blog contains only public information and articles, and therefore no customer data or critical information from the blog  has been compromised. Our security team has already fixed the issue to ensure the blog is secure." For Santander's customers, as well as all other banking customers, we'd recommend that you always check the domain and subdomain that a suspicious bank email is sending you to.
