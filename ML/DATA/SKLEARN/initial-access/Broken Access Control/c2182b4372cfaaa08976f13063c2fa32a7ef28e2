This time, ironically, database appeared to be handled by Veeam, company that develops backup, disaster recovery and intelligent data management software for virtual, physical and multi-cloud infrastructures. A 200-GB database included vast massives of data that is apparently used by Veeam marketing automation team to reach out to their customers using Marketo solution. Collections labeled 'marketo', 'marketo new' and 'marketo-collect' contained in total more than 445 million records with information about customer's first and last name, email, email recipient type, country, attributes values, and customer organization size, Commercial, SMB, ENT - Enterprise). Based on the collection names and analysis of data in the database, my first guess was that database originated from Marketo server, so I also sent security notifications to their email addresses. Upon further analysis I came to conclusion that data was part of Veeam marketing server infrastructure, rather than Marketo. Database has been quietly secured shortly after security notification sent to Veeam PR team. FollowSeems like Veeam exposed marketing info of hundreds of millions of its customers.
