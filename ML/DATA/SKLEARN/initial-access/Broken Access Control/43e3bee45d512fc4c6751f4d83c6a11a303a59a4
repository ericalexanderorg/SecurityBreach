An investigation is underway into a booking software vulnerability that exposed airline passenger name records, which is a bundle of personal and travel data that gets collected whenever someone books a flight. El Al uses a booking system from Amadeus, a Madrid-based company based that works with 500 airlines, including United Airlines and Air Canada. Airlines typically issue a six-digit alphanumeric booking reference code whenever someone books their ticket. El Al sends customers a link to a web page to check their PNR. But Rotem discovered that he could insert a random booking reference number into the link. With that information in hand, it's possible to access someone else's booking information using the booking reference number and the last name of a passenger. Global distribution systems, such as the one run by Amadeus and other booking software providers, including Sabre and Travelport, date back decades. "The way 6-digit booking codes are chosen makes them weaker than a 5-digit password (". In the short term, Nohl and Nikodijevic recommended airlines employ Captchas and also limit the number of requests per IP address.
