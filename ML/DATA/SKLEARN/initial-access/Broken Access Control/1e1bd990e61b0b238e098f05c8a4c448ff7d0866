Veeam, a backup and data recovery company, bills itself as a data giant that among other things can "Anticipate need and meet demand, and move securely across multi-cloud infrastructures," but is believed to have mislaid its own database of customer records. Security researcher Bob Diachenko found an exposed database containing more than 200 gigabytes of customer records, mostly names, email addresses, and in some cases IP addresses. Diachenko, who blogged about his latest find, the database didn't have a password and could be accessed by anyone knowing where to look. The database of more than 200 gigabytes - including two collections that had 199.1 million and 244.4 million email addresses and records respectively over a four-year period between 2013 and 2017. It's not the first time a massive database of email addresses has leaked online. An exposed database run by River City Media leaked over 393 million email addresses in 2017, which prompted a frivolous lawsuit against the security researcher who found it. Later in the year, a massive spambot of 711 million email addresses, believed to be largest ever, was uncovered last year by a Paris-based researcher.
