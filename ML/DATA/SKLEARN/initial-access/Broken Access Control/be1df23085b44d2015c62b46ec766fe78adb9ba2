CyberNews researchers discovered an unsecured data bucket that belongs to View Media containing close to 39 million US citizen records. The CyberNews research team discovered an unsecured data bucket that belongs to View Media, an online marketing company. The bucket contains close to 39 million US citizen records, including their full names, email and street addresses, phone numbers and ZIP codes. Following the 350 million email leak covered by CyberNews earlier in August, this is the second time this summer we encountered an unsecured Amazon bucket containing such massive amounts of user data. The user record files were created based on locations and ZIP codes that the marketing company's campaigns were targeting and contained full names, addresses, zip codes, emails, and phone numbers of people based in the US. Aside from the statement of work documents and user records, the bucket contained thousands of files for various marketing materials, such as banner advertisements, newsletters, and promotional flyers. Apart from millions of US citizen records, the bucket also contains thousands of marketing newsletters, promotional flyer designs, banner ads, and statement of work documents created by View Media for its clients. We then reached out to one of the marketing company's clients mentioned in the statement of work documents that were stored on the bucket, who helped us identify View Media as the owner of the database on August 21.
