Smart home tech maker Wyze Labs confirmed that the user data of over 2.4 million of its users were exposed by an unsecured database connected to an Elasticsearch cluster for over three weeks, from December 4 to December 26. The company discovered the incident after receiving an inquiry from an IPVM reporter via a "Support ticket at 9:21 a.m. on December 26," immediately followed by IPVM publishing a piece "At 9:35 a.m" covering the exposed database discovered by security consulting firm Twelve Security. The unsecured data was a copy of the company's production database containing a subset of all its users' info and it was created by Wyze to "Measure basic business metrics like device activations, failed connection rates" by querying the number of connected devices, connectivity errors, and more. The information that Wyze had an exposed Elasticsearch cluster was also confirmed by Security Discovery researcher Bob Diachenko who said that the connected database contained 1,807,201,457 records including log data, API requests, and events. As per my records, Wyze had huge Elasticsearch cluster publicly exposed. Wyze had the health info of 140 external beta testers stored within the exposed database as part of a limited new hardware beta test. As a precautionary measure Wyze logged out all users by pushing a token refresh and "Added another level of protection to our system databases."
