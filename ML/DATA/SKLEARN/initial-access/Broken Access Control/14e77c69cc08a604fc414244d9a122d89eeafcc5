The past few days have showered plenty of favorable attention on a new trading platform called DX.Exchange, with glowing profiles by Bloomberg News and CNBC. The only problem is that the site, which allows people to trade currencies and digitized versions of Apple, Tesla, and other stocks, has been leaking oodles of account login credentials and personal user information. Besides spilling user data and allowing unauthorized access to user accounts, the leak puts the entire security of the site in serious jeopardy because some of the leaked tokens appear to belong to employees of the site. In the event that such a token gave unauthorized access to an account with administrative privileges, the hacker might be able to download entire databases, seed the site with malware, and possibly even transfer funds out of user accounts. Ars sent emails to users of eight randomly chosen tokens to ask if they had accounts on the site. A few hours later, officials announced a site maintenance update, but even after the site came back online, the leak continued. The favorable attention showered on DX.Exchange is unfortunate, because it detracts attention from several security weaknesses that should serve as warning signs that the site may not be adequately safeguarding the tremendous amount of sensitive data it requires users to provide. Best practices call for authentication tokens to be time stamped and then signed with a private encryption key each time a user sends it to a site.
