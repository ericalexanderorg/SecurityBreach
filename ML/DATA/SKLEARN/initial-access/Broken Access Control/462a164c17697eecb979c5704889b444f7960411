The personal information more than a million users of popular adult website Luscious, including email addresses that sometimes indicated full names, were found exposed in an unsecured Elasticsearch database. The website, which focuses on anime-themed, user-uploaded adult content, has over 1 million registered users. Website users have a private profile allowing them to upload, share, and comment on the website's pornographic content - while keeping their identities hidden behind usernames. "The data breach gave our team access to 1.195 million user accounts on Luscious. All of these were compromised, revealing personal details of users with potentially devastating consequences," said researchers with vpnMentor in a post this week. "The highly sensitive and private nature of Luscious' content makes users incredibly vulnerable to a range of attacks and exploitation by malicious hackers." If hackers were able to access the user data - particularly for something as sensitive as an adult dating website - it could be ruinous for victims' relationships and personal lives. "The impact of this data breach on users could be devastating, personally and financially," they said.
