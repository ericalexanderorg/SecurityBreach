On July 19, 2019, we determined that an outside individual gained unauthorized access and obtained certain types of personal information about Capital One credit card customers and individuals who had applied for our credit card products. The largest category of information accessed was information on consumers and small businesses as of the time they applied for one of our credit card products from 2005 through early 2019. This information included personal information Capital One routinely collects at the time it receives credit card applications, including names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and self-reported income. About 140,000 Social Security numbers of our credit card customers. About 80,000 linked bank account numbers of our secured credit card customers. For our Canadian credit card customers, approximately 1 million Social Insurance Numbers were compromised in this incident. For our Canadian credit card customers, please visit our website at www.
