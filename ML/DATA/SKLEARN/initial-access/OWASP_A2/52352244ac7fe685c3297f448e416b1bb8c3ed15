Updated Citrix today warned its customers that foreign hackers romped through its internal company network and stole corporate secrets. According to infosec firm Resecurity, which had earlier alerted the Feds and Citrix to the cyber-intrusion, at least six terabytes of sensitive internal files were swiped from the US corporation by the Iranian-backed IRIDIUM hacker gang. "Based our recent analysis, the threat actors leveraged a combination of tools, techniques and procedures, allowing them to conduct targeted network intrusion to access at least six terabytes of sensitive data stored in the Citrix enterprise network, including email correspondence, files in network shares, and other services used for project management and procurement." Citrix said it took action - launching an internal probe and securing its networks - after hearing from the FBI earlier this week. Earlier today, Citrix chief information security officer Stan Black gave his company's side of the story. As a massive provider of remote management, networking, and videoconferencing products, Citrix has an extremely large portfolio spread across a number of sectors in the enterprise IT market. For now, Citrix said it is planning to cooperate fully with the FBI probe, and has also brought in an outside security firm to help investigate the intrusion and make sure that hackers will not be able to get back in to the network.
