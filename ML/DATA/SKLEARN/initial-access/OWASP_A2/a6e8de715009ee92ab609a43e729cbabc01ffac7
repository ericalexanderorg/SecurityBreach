As soon as we learned of the breach, the server and our contract with the provider were terminated and we began an extensive audit of our service. To prevent any similar incidents, among other means, we encrypt the hard disk of each new server we build. A few months ago, we became aware of an incident in March 2018 when a server at a datacenter in Finland we had been renting servers from was accessed without authorization. Once we found out about the incident, we first terminated our contract with the provider and eliminated the server, which we had operated since January 31, 2018. Thoroughly reviewing the providers and configurations for over 5,000 servers around the world takes time. The breach affected one of over 3,000 servers we had at the time for a limited time period, but that's no excuse for an egregious mistake that never should have been made. We should have done more to filter out unreliable server providers and ensure the security of our customers.
