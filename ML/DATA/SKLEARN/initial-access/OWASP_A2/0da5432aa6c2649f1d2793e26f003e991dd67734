On September 25th, 2018, Facebook learned from its engineering team that a security vulnerability compromised around 50 million accounts. As Facebook mentions on their Security Update, these tokens are the "Equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to Facebook so they don't need to re-enter their password every time they use the app." Thus, for this type of data breach, changing the user's password doesn't provide risk mitigation. Facebook has reset the access tokens of the almost 50 million accounts that were determined to be at risk in order to diminish any risk to the user data and to ensure their personal and digital security. As a precautionary step, Facebook has also reset the access tokens for another 40 million accounts. As a result of these security measures, about 90 million users will have to log back into the Facebook platform. Facebook wants to remain transparent and direct in the acknowledgment and communication of this security breach. As the security investigation is on its early stage, Facebook has yet to determine if any of the compromised accounts had their data accessed or misused.
