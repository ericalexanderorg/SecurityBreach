A ransomware infection at a natural gas compression facility in the United States resulted in a two-day operational shutdown of an entire pipeline asset, the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency revealed on Tuesday. A compression facility helps transport natural gas from one location to another through a pipeline. Natural gas needs to be highly pressurized during transportation, and compression facilities along the pipeline help ensure that it remains pressurized. Human operators could no longer monitor processes, but CISA said the attack did not affect programmable logic controllers and the targeted organization never lost control of operations. The victim decided to respond to the attack by shutting down operations. While the ransomware only directly affected one facility, other compression facilities were also forced to suspend operations due to pipeline transmission dependencies. The agency published an alert to warn gas and other critical infrastructure operators about the risk of cyberattacks, and provide recommendations for mitigating the threat.
