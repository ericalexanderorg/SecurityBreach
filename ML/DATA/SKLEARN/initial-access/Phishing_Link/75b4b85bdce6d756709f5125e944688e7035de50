Cybercriminals managed to divert $2.5 million in a business email compromise scam targeting Cabarrus County, North Carolina. The attack started at the end of November 2018, when employees of Cabarrus County Schools and Cabarrus County Government received emails pretending to be from Roanoke, Virginia-based Branch and Associates, Inc., the general contractor for construction of West Cabarrus High, a new school for the Cabarrus County Schools District. As soon as the funds arrived in their account, the scammers started diverting them through multiple different accounts. Cabarrus County says that construction of the new high school has not been impacted. Losses associated with BEC scams in the U.S. reached $1.3 billion last year alone, and the number of received complaints also went up, the FBI revealed. Earlier this year, Agari detailed a new type of BEC fraud, where scammers attempt to divert funds by adding fictional accounts to company payrolls. The fight against BEC has intensified as well, with authorities worldwide joining forces to dismantle large networks of scammers.
