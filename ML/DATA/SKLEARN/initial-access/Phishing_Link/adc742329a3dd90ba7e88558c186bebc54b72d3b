A cyber threat actor used a Spearphishing Link [T1192] to obtain initial access to the organization's information technology network before pivoting to its OT network. The threat actor then deployed commodity ransomware to Encrypt Data for Impact [T1486] on both networks. CISA is providing this Alert to help administrators and network defenders protect their organizations against this and similar ransomware attacks. Technical Details Network and Assets The victim failed to implement robust segmentation between the IT and OT networks, which allowed the adversary to traverse the IT-OT boundary and disable assets on both networks. The threat actor used commodity ransomware to compromise Windows-based assets on both the IT and OT networks. Technical and Architectural Mitigations Implement and ensure robust Network Segmentation [M1030] between IT and OT networks to limit the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network is compromised. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.
