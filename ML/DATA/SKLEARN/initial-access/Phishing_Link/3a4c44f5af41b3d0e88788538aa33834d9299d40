A non-profit community housing collective has been swindled out of more than $1.2 million in a business email compromise campaign. Red Kite Community Housing, a coop housing association in High Wycombe, U.K. announced in a recent website notice that £932,000 of the money paid into its coffers by tenant-owners was transferred to cybercrooks thanks to a convincing domain-spoofing effort. The attack happened in August, after which Red Kite notified its members, and engaged an outside cyber-forensics firm, local police and the Regulator of Social Housing. "As a community organization [sic] that has built a track record of saving our residents over £33 million in the first five years, and almost another £30 million on our long-term business plan, it is absolutely galling to lose a [pound], let alone the sum involved in this crime." The Manor Independent School District in the Austin, Texas area lost $2.3 million, after falling victim to an email scam that ran for nearly two months at the end of 2019. Last April, St. Ambrose Catholic Parish in Ohio lost a whopping $1.75 million after attackers breached two employees' email accounts - and then tricked other employees into sending wire transfers to a fraudulent bank account. According to the latest annual Internet Crime Report from the FBI, individuals suffer BEC scams too: One victim received an email purporting to be from a closing agent during a real-estate transaction - resulting in the person initiating a wire transfer of $50,000 to a fraudster's bank account located in New York.
