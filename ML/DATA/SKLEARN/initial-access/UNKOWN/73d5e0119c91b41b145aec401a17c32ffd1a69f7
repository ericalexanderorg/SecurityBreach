The push-to-talk app, Zello, has disclosed a data breach that revealed user's email addresses and hashed passwords after discovering unauthorized activity on their systems. Zello is a mobile service with 140 million users that allows first responders, hospitality services, transportation, and family and friends to communicate via their mobile phones using a push-to-talk app. According to the notification, Zello Work and Zello for First Responders customers were not affected by this breach. As Zello requires users to login with a username and password, and as usernames were not accessed, they do not feel that any accounts were improperly accessed. To be safe, Zello is forcing a mandatory password reset on all Zello accounts the next time they log into the service. All affected users need to change their password at any site that utilizes the same password as their Zello account. A password manager can help facilitate the creation of unique passwords at every site you visit without memorizing them.
