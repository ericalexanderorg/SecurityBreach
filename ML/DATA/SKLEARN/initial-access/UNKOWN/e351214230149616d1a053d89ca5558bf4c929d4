If you've booked trips through Orbitz, hackers may have accessed your credit card or other payment card information in a recent attack. Reports from March 20, 2018, state that up to 880,000 payment card numbers and related information could've been exposed in a data breach. In the second disclosure, customer data from other travel sites that used Orbitz to book travel between Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 22, 2017, may have been compromised, according to published reports. The Orbitz breach is a reminder that it's good to regularly review credit card and bank statements, looking for unfamiliar transactions. Keep in mind that it can be safer to use credit cards instead of debit cards when making purchases. That's because debit cards give fraudsters direct access to the money in your checking account. With a credit card, your bank account isn't affected until you make a card payment.
