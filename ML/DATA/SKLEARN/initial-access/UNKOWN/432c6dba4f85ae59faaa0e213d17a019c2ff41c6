On October 4th, Pentagon officials were alerted to a data breach that affected its personnel. The data was accessed via a system that maintained travel records. Joseph Buccino downplayed the incident saying that only "a very small percentage of the total population" of employees were impacted. It's the nation's largest employer with 1.3 million enlisted men and women and another 742,000 civilian employees. The Department has not named the vendor that was victimized because its investigation is ongoing. This incident underscores the difficulties faced by large, complex organizations and businesses when it comes to securing data. It's hard enough to ensure in-house systems are properly secured.
