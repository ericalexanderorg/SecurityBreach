Cybercriminals are using software from leading ATM manufacturer Diebold in a series of hacks against cash terminals across Europe, forcing the machines to dispense cash to crooks. Criminals using a black-box device common with these type of attacks have increased their activity across Europe by targeting Diebold's ProCash 2050xe USB terminals, according to an Active Security Alert by Diebold Nixdorf released last week. It's as yet unclear about how attackers gained access to the internal software of the machines, according to Diebold. So called Jackpotting attacks are those in which cybercriminals find a way to hack into an ATM machine to trigger the machine to release cash, much like a slot machine at a casino-hence the name. Diebold is one of the top players in the ATM market, earning $3.3 billion in sales last year from its ATM business, which includes both selling and servicing machines around the world. To mitigate attacks, Diebold made a few suggestions to terminal operators, including advising them to implement the latest protection on the machines by using only software updated with current security functionality and ensuring encryption is active on the terminal. The company also advised customers to implement hard-disk encryption mechanisms to protect the terminal from software modification and offline attacks, as well as limit physical access to the machine to prevent access by destroying the machine facade, as occurred in the current spate of jackpotting attacks.
