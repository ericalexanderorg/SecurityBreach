The Ryuk threat actors went from a phishing email to domain wide ransomware in 5 hours. After moving laterally to the secondary domain controller, the threat actor started on more domain discovery via Net and the PowerShell Active Directory module. The threat actors finished their objective by executing the ransomware on the primary domain controller, and at the 5 hour mark, the attack completed. Ran on the beachhead. nltest /domain trusts /all trusts nltest /dclist:DOMAIN net group "Domain admins" /DOMAIN. Ran on a domain controller. After already completing the above discovery work and having already pivoted to their 2nd domain controller, the threat actors moved on to AdFind for further domain reconnaissance. Pivoted off of our prior Ryuk report and used the network data to link several of these domains which we saw in this case. Starting around 4.5 hours after the initial Bazar malware was executed, the Ryuk threat actors acted on their final objectives and initiated RDP connections from the domain controller previously exploited, to the rest of the environment.
