The Krystal Company would like to advise guests that our company is actively investigating a security incident that involves one of the payment processing systems that services some of our restaurants. Although our investigation is in its early stages, we have learned that the security incident may have involved payment cards processed by a payment processing system used at certain restaurants between July through September 2019. Krystal uses multiple payment processing systems and, as a result, not all Krystal restaurants have been impacted by this incident. Krystal will provide updates to guests once we have completed our investigation and know more about payment cards that may have been impacted. Krystal is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers and will continue to take quick action. Krystal is working hard to determine the specific locations and dates for each restaurant involved in the attack. If you do not see a specific restaurant location when searching this tool, that restaurant has not been identified as potentially impacted.
