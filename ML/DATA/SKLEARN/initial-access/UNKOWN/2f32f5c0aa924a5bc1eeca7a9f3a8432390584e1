The Port of Kennewick, Washington reports that it is the latest target to suffer a crippling cyber-attack. The small port region far up the Columbia River and more than 180 miles southeast of the Port of Seattle demonstrates the indiscriminate nature of cybercrime and the danger to ports of all sizes. In 29011, the port of Antwerp experienced an intruder into its systems while many of the largest shipping companies also experienced cyber-attacks. While the Port of Kennewick may not be as visible, the attack has been just as devastating on the municipal corporation serving communities, including Kennewick, Richland, West Richland, into Benton County, along the Columbia River. On November 17, port officials discovered that its systems had been victimized by a digital ransom-ware attack. While the source of the attack is unknown, they suspect it may have come from a fraudulent email sent to an employee of the port. The port's technology team is working to reestablish functionality for the Port of Kennewick's technology systems.
