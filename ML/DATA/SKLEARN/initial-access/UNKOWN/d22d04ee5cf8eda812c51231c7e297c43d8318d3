PerCSoft, a Wisconsin-based company that manages a remote data backup service relied upon by hundreds of dental offices across the country, is struggling to restore access to client systems after falling victim to a ransomware attack. West Allis, Wis.-based PerCSoft is a cloud management provider for Digital Dental Record, which operates an online data backup service called DDS Safe that archives medical records, charts, insurance documents and other personal information for various dental offices across the United States. The ransomware attack hit PerCSoft on the morning of Monday, Aug. 26, and encrypted dental records for some - but not all - of the practices that rely on DDS Safe. Director of communications for the Wisconsin Dental Association, said the ransomware encrypted files for approximate 400 dental practices, and that somewhere between 80-100 of those clients have now had their files restored. Some affected dental offices have reported that the decryptor did not work to unlock at least some of the files encrypted by the ransomware. Cloud data and backup services are a prime target of cybercriminals who deploy ransomware. In July, attackers hit QuickBooks cloud hosting firm iNSYNQ, holding data hostage for many of the company's clients.
