"Marriott learned during the investigation that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014," said the statement. The company said hat it obtained and decrypted the database on November 19 and "Determined that the contents were from the Starwood guest reservation database." Some 327 million records contained a guest's name, postal address, phone number, date of birth, gender, email address, passport number, Starwood's rewards information, arrival and departure information, reservation date, and their communication preferences. Starwood said an unknown number of records contained encrypted credit card data, but has "Not been able to rule out" that the components needed to decrypt the data wasn't also taken. Marriott-owned Starwood the largest hotel chain in the world, with more than 11 brands covering 1,200 properties, including W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element and more. Starwood branded timeshare properties are also included. The company has begun informing customers of the breach - including in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Given that the breach falls under the European-wide GDPR rules, Starwood may face significant financial penalties of up to four percent of its global annual revenue if found to be in breach of the rules.
