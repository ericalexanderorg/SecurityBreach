Experts from Recorded Future's Insikt Group linked a series of attacks, part of RedFoxtrot China-linked campaigns, to the PLA China-linked Unit 69010. According to a report released today by Recorded Future's Insikt Group, the People's Liberation Army Unit 69010 is believed to have been behind a series of cyber-espionage campaigns dating back to 2014 that have focused on gathering military intelligence from neighboring countries. Insikt Group tracked the threat actors behind the campaigns as RedFoxtrot threat actor, the cyberspies targeted government, defense, and telecommunications sectors across Central Asia, India, and Pakistan,. The arsenal of the group included malware employed in campaigns linked to Chinese cyber espionage groups, including Icefog, PlugX, RoyalRoad, Poison Ivy, ShadowPad, and PCShare. Insikt researchers linked Chinese nation-state activity to RedFoxtrot and PLA Unit 69010 due to the lax operational security of one of the members of the group behind the long-running campaign. The researchers reported that in 2020, RedFoxtrot, alongside multiple other PLA and MSS-affiliated nation-state groups, likely gained access to the ShadowPad backdoor. "With continued activity from suspected PLA groups such as Tonto Team, Tick, Naikon, and RedFoxtrot, and the emergence of new Chinese threat activity groups with suspected PLA links, Insikt Group believes that PLA-affiliated groups remain prominent within the Chinese cyber espionage sphere despite increased attention on their MSS counterparts." concludes the report.
