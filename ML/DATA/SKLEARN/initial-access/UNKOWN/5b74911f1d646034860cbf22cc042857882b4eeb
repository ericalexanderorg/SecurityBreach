Hospital network Nebraska Medicine has disclosed a data breach after a former employee accessed sensitive patient data - including medical records and Social Security numbers. The Nebraska Medicine network encompasses Nebraska's largest hospital, Nebraska Medical Center, as well as other locations like Bellevue Medical Center. On Oct. 1, during an audit of its electronic medical record system, Nebraska Medicine discovered that an employee had accessed patient records "Outside of the employee's job responsibilities." The employee was terminated the next day. "Once Nebraska Medicine became aware of the incident, our staff took action to investigate, prevent further improper access and to notify affected patients," a spokesperson told Threatpost. Nebraska Medicine did not comment on how many patients were affected. Of these incidents, 28 involved unauthorized access or disclosure breaches similar to that of Nebraska Medicine. To help prevent future similar incidents, Nebraska Medicine said it will continue to regularly audit their electronic medical record system for potential unauthorized activity, and are also retraining staff about appropriate access of patient information.
