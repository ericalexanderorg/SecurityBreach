Key IT systems at the University of Portsmouth continue to remain offline this week after a supposed ransomware attack, delaying the start of the new term. A notice on the university's homepage doesn't explicitly name ransomware as the cause of the "Cyber incident," but the "Ongoing technical disruption" it describes is a tell-tale sign of such attacks. The News has reported that it has seen an email from the university claiming it suffered a ransomware attack. Although it was due to open on Monday for the start of the summer term, the university campus will continue to remain closed to students until Wednesday, according to a BBC report. Last week we reported how the University of Hertfordshire in southern England suffered a major ransomware-related outage taking down its network for days. A report last year claimed that a third of UK universities have been hit with ransomware over the past decade. Situated on Britain's south coast, Portsmouth University has around 25,000 students.
