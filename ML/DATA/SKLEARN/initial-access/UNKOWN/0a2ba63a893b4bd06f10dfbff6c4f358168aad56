The breach involved private user information, including phone numbers, dates of birth, frequent flier membership numbers and passport and government ID numbers, as well as information on passengers' past travels. The airline said that 27 credit card numbers - but not their corresponding security codes - had been obtained, as had 403 expired credit card numbers. The company said that no passwords were compromised, and that the breach would not affect flight operations or safety. The security breach has come at a tough time for the company, which counts the state-backed carrier Air China as a major shareholder. In an era when issues of data protection have come to the fore in Washington and other global capitals, the Cathay breach does not stand out for its scale. The airline said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that around 860,000 passport numbers and 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers had been exposed. Delta Air Lines said earlier this year that customer payment information had been exposed after a security breach at a company that provided online chat services for it.
