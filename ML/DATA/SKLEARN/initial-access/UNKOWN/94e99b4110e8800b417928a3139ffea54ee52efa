For the first time, the operators behind the Sodinokibi Ransomware have released files stolen from one of their victims because a ransom was not paid in time. Since last month, the representatives of the Sodinokibi, otherwise known as REvil, have publicly stated that they would begin to follow Maze's example and publish data stolen from victims if they do not pay a ransom. "This is a small part of what we have. If there are no movements, we will sell the remaining, more important and interesting commercial and personal data to third parties, including financial details." BleepingComputer has reached out to Artech with questions related to the ransomware attack, but have not heard back. As we have been saying over and over, ransomware attacks need to be treated with transparency and as a data breach. By trying to hide these attacks, and the theft of employee, company, and customer data, companies are not only risking fines and lawsuits but are also putting personal data at risk. This practice of using stolen data as leverage is not going to go away and is only going to get worse.
