Cybersecurity researchers at Google's Threat Analysis Group today revealed that an unnamed group of hackers used no fewer than five zero-day vulnerabilities, secret hackable flaws in software, to target North Koreans and North Korea-focused professionals in 2019. Google declined to comment on who might be responsible for the attacks, but Russian security firm Kaspersky tells WIRED it has linked Google's findings with DarkHotel, a group that has targeted North Koreans in the past and is suspected of working on behalf of the South Korean government. "The majority of targets we observed were from North Korea or individuals who worked on North Korea-related issues," In a followup email, Google clarified that a subset of the victims were not merely from North Korea, but in the country, suggesting that these targets weren't North Korean defectors, whom the North Korean regime frequently targets. Within hours of Google linking the zero-day vulnerabilities to attacks targeting North Koreans, Kaspersky was able to match two of the vulnerabilities-one in Windows, one in Internet Explorer-with those it has specifically tied to DarkHotel. Raiu points out that DarkHotel has a long history of hacking North Korean and Chinese victims, with a focus on espionage. DarkHotel's hackers are believed to have been active since at least 2007, but Kaspersky gave the group its name in 2014 when it discovered that the group was compromising hotel Wi-Fi networks to carry out highly targeted attacks against specific hotel guests based on their room numbers. In just the last three years, Raiu says Kaspersky has found DarkHotel using three zero-day vulnerabilities beyond the five now linked to the group based on Google's blog post.
