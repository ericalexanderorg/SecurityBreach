Among other things, has recovered its service after discovering a Magecart skimmer on its website was leaching credit card numbers earlier in October. The firm said that data on an undisclosed number of transactions to approximately 300 schools may have been stolen when users who thought they were making legitimate payments were redirected, without their knowledge, to a malicious external page masquerading as Wisepay's website. Often, Magecart attacks begin in a targeted spearphishing attack on a member of staff at the victim organisation, but cyber criminals have also been known to exploit unsecured Amazon Web Services S3 buckets and unpatched versions of Adobe's Magento software, which is about to enter end-of-life. "ProPrivacy's Attila Tomaschek said:"The Wisepay cyber attack highlights very clearly the dangers of online card skimming attacks. Wisepay would be an attractive target for cyber criminals looking to launch such an attack due to the large number of UK schools served by the online payment portal. "The main problem is that these types of attacks can be incredibly difficult to detect and avoid. Those entering their credit card information into a compromised payment page would really have no idea that they were handing their card details over to cyber criminals because these malicious payment pages are designed to appear perfectly legitimate." "Given the turmoil in the education sector right now thanks to Covid, this is yet another headache for schools. There has been a spate of highly publicised ransomware attacks against universities recently, likely timed to coincide with the start of term - which attackers hope will increase their chances of success," he said.
