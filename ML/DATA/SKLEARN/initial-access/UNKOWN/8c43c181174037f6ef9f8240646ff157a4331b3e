The majority of the reporting claimed that the point of compromise was due to a payment software called Click2Gov which was hosted on local servers. All three reports claimed that the point of compromise was the Click2Gov software. In the past 30 days, Gemini Advisory has identified over 12,283 compromised payment cards associated with the Click2Gov breach, of which approximately 4,000 cards are associated with previously unseen Topeka, KS and indicating that hackers still maintain the access to infiltrated systems. Gemini Advisory has provided all of the Click2Gov associated breach information to Federal Law Enforcement and is actively working to assist them in further investigation. Thus, Gemini Advisory suggests that users who are directed to pay through the Click2Gov system identify alternative means of making payments until the system threat has been eliminated. All local municipalities that utilize the Click2Gov software should confirm that the software is up-to-date and fully patched, and contact CentralSquare immediately if assistance is needed. Gemini Advisory is monitoring the development of the Click2Gov incident closely, and in the case that new victims are identified, all clients will be notified accordingly.
