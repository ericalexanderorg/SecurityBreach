"As soon as the security breach was detected, external access to applications was interrupted to prevent the malware from spreading. Our teams are fully mobilized and access to our information systems is gradually resuming," the company said in an emailed statement. "The CMA CGM network remains available to the Group's customers for all booking and operation requests. An investigation is underway, conducted by our internal experts and by independent experts." The company shared on its Twitter account that external access to its IT applications and booking systems were unavailable. These include the business sites for CMA CGM, APL, ANL and CNC. Some media outlets reported that the company has been hit by a ransomware attack by the Ragnar Locker group. CMA CGM is the fourth container shipping company to experience a cyber attack including MSC, Cosco Shipping, and Maersk. The Geneva-based container shipping major explained that the attack had a limited impact on its operations and that its cargo operations continued as normal. MSC's 2M Alliance partner Maersk experienced a cyber attack back in 2017, which cost the company approximately $300 million.
