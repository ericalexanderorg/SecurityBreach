The U.S. Coast Guard published a marine safety alert to inform of a Ryuk Ransomware attack that took down the entire corporate IT network of a Maritime Transportation Security Act regulated facility. "Once the embedded malicious link in the email was clicked by an employee, the ransomware allowed for a threat actor to access significant enterprise Information Technology network files, and encrypt them, preventing the facility's access to critical files," says the USCG. The USCG issued another safety alert in July with cybersecurity guidance after a cyber incident experienced by a deep draft vessel during February affected the ship's entire network. Even though the Marine Safety Information Bulletin doesn't mention the type of facility or its name, it's safe to assume that it must be a port seeing that the ransomware managed to infiltrate cargo transfer industrial control systems. "The virus further burrowed into the industrial control systems that monitor and control cargo transfer and encrypted files critical to process operations," adds the USCG. The systems encrypted by Ryuk Ransomware directly impacted the facility's "Entire corporate IT network" and physical access and camera control systems, and it also led to "Loss of critical process control monitoring systems." UK's National Cyber Security Centre also published an advisory in June detailing Ryuk Ransomware campaigns targeting organizations around the globe including guidance on how to protect against ransomware attacks. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued its own advisory on how to prevent and respond to ransomware infections, as well as advice on what to do after a ransomware infection. To make matters worse for individuals and organizations affected by a Ryuk Ransomware attack, it has recently been discovered that this strain's decryptor has a bug that could lead to data loss in large files.
