A Mississippi school district has voted to pay $300,000 to recover files that were encrypted during a suspected ransomware attack. A federal investigation was launched after threat actors accessed Yazoo County School District's information technology system without authorization. Superintendent Dr. Ken Barron told WLBT news that the school became aware of the cyber-attack on Monday, October 12. Following the attack, the school took its IT systems offline and engaged a cybersecurity firm to help recover data encrypted by threat actors. The school board voted to pay a company $300,000 to recover the data that was encrypted by malware. "Last week, the Yazoo County School District detected a potential cyber event impacting certain devices on our network. We took our IT systems offline to investigate and address. National cyber-security firms were engaged to assist. We also reported this to federal law enforcement," wrote Barron in a statement issued by the school. Lincoln County Schools, another Mississippi school district, fell victim to a ransomware attack in November 2019.
