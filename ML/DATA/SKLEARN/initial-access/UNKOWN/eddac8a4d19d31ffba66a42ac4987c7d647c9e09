A ransomware gang is threatening to leak sensitive police files that may expose police investigations and informants unless the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia agrees to pay a ransom demand. "We are aware of unauthorized access on our server," Sean Hickman, a public spokesperson for DC Police, told The Record in an email today after screenshots of the department's internal files and servers were published on the website of the Babuk Locker ransomware gang. The screenshots suggested the ransomware gang had obtained access to investigation reports, officer disciplinary files, documents on local gangs, mugshots, and administrative files. In total, the Babuk Locker gang claims it downloaded more than 250 GB of data from DC Police servers. The group is now giving DC Police officials three days to respond to their ransom demand; otherwise, they say they will contact local gangs and expose police informants. DC Police officials told The Record they are still investigating the breach to determine its full impact. The Babuk Locker gang is one of the most recent ransomware groups today.
