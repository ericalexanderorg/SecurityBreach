A Philadelphia tech company which provides the software currently used in COVID-19 vaccine trials has suffered a ransomware attack, the CEO has confirmed. ERT said clinical trial patients were never at risk, but customers said the attack forced trial researchers to track their patients with pen and paper. Several of ERT's clients were hit - among them IQVIA, the contract research organization helping manage AstraZeneca's COVID vaccine trial, and Bristol Myers Squibb, the drugmaker leading a consortium of companies to develop a quick test for the virus. ERT has not said how many clinical trials were affected, but its software is used in drug trials across Europe, Asia and North America. Bristol Myers Squibb also said the impact of the attack had been limited but other ERT customers had to move their clinical trials to pen and paper. In a statement, IQVIA said that the attack had 'had limited impact on our clinical trials operations'. Ransomware attacks are an increasing threat, especially given the huge pressure on companies to come up with a safe COVID vaccine.
