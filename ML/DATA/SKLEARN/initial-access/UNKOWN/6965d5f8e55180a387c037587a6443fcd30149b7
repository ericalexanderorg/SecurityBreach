The campaigns were based on several tools, including "Living off the land" tools, which makes attribution difficult, as well as different hacking tools and a custom built backdoor. Once the victims were compromised, attackers started to bring reconnaissance tools for network scanning and credential gathering or tools with multiple functionalities, such as CrackMapExec. O Reviewing the incident timeline, we observed the following sequence: deployment of the modified PuTTY tool on one of the machines; a specific user is created four days after, on the same system; the user account is created on other systems from that network, during the following days; Beside the aforementioned tools, under this user account, we also saw the rdpwinst tool, which allows multiple rdp sessions management, Smartftp Password Decryptor - the installer, and Navicat Premium, a database management tool. Custom build tools PLINK Tool A slightly modified version of PLINK, part of the PuTTY suite, was also revealed by Bitdefender telemetry in late September 2018. Proxy Tools Beside PLINK, we spotted a command line tool, written in C++, that implements a proxy. Scanning tools Bitdefender telemetry revealed another command line tool used in this attack, "Xnet.exe", which is very similar to the known nbtscan tool, except it packs an additional feature. Interestingly, there is a connection between this file and the "Xnet.exe" tool described in the Scanning tools section above, as indicated by some very similar yet uncommon pdb paths: "F:Projects94-06RCEbinReleasex64mas.pdb" - in "Mas.dll" tool "F:Projects94-08XNetbinReleaseWin32XNet.pdb") - in "Xnet.exe" tool These two tools also share common functions in their code, some of them for debugging purposes.
