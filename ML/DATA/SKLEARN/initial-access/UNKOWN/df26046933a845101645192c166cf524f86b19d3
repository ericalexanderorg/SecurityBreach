A database containing credentials from more than 26 million LiveJournal accounts has been leaked online and is being sold on the Dark Web and hacker forums. A now-defunct data-leak tracking service, We Leak Info, tweeted in July 2019 about a 2014 leak of 33 million LiveJournal accounts. The Have I Been Pawned listing cites "Multiple reports of credential abuse" against a company called Dreamwidth, a spinoff of LiveJournal based on its original code base with a significant number of crossover users. The tweet seems to be backed up by a blog post from Dreamwidth co-founder and former LiveJournal staffer Mark Smith from April, which informs users of an update to the site's authentication mechanism from outdated and insecure LiveJournal protocols to more secure web infrastructure. The post stops short at acknowledging that any attacks were occurring based on data leaked from a LiveJournal breach. There is earlier evidence from a couple of years ago that shows threat attackers using LiveJournal data for other scams. A Twitter user who responded to a tweet by Hunt in 2018 - when rumors were circulating about a potential unconfirmed LiveJournal breach-said that hackers tried to extort money from him based on acquiring data from the breach.
