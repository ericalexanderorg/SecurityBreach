FireEye Mandiant recently discovered a new malware family used by APT41 that is designed to monitor and save SMS traffic from specific phone numbers, IMSI numbers and keywords for subsequent theft. The malware searches the SMS message contents for keywords from the keywordVec list, compares the IMSI number with numbers from the imsiMap list, and checks the extracted phone numbers with the numbers in the phoneMap list. The malware compares the IMSI number and phone numbers with the values from the imsiMap and phoneMap lists. If an SMS message contained either a phone number or an IMSI number that matched the predefined list, it was saved to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor. If any SMS messages contained these keywords, MESSAGETAP would save the SMS message to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor. In contrast, MESSAGETAP captures the contents of specific text messages. Looking Ahead. The use of MESSAGETAP and targeting of sensitive text messages and call detail records at scale is representative of the evolving nature of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns observed by FireEye.
