Poshmark, an online marketplace where North American users can buy and sell new or used clothes, shoes, and accessories, disclosed a data breach yesterday, on August 1. The company said that an unauthorized party gained access to its servers from where it stole information such as usernames, hashed passwords, first and last names, gender information, and city of residence. The hacker also stole clothing size preferences, user emails, and social media profile information collected when users connected social media accounts to Poshmark, the company said. The hacker also got their hands on some less important information, such as some internal Poshmark account preferences, used by the company to send email and browser and mobile push notifications. Poshmark did not reveal when the breach occurred or when the company found out about it. In a blog post and a security notice posted on its website, the online marketplace said it contracted a security vendor following the discovery of the breach, and that a security audit performed by this vendor did not reveal "Any material vulnerabilities" that the hacker might have exploited. Last year, fashion retailer SHEIN announced a similar security breach during which a hacker stole the details of 6.42 million users.
