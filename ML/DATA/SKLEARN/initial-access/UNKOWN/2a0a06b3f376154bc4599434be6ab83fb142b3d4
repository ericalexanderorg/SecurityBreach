A hack-for-hire group, called Dark Basin, has been outed after targeting thousands of individuals and organizations worldwide - including advocacy groups and journalists, elected and senior government officials, and hedge funds - over the course of seven years. Dark Basin conducted commercial espionage on behalf of their clients, against customers' opponents involved in high-profile public events, criminal cases, financial transactions, news stories and advocacy, according to researchers at Citizen Lab. "Citizen Lab has notified hundreds of targeted individuals and institutions and, where possible, provided them with assistance in tracking and identifying the campaign," according to a report on Dark Basin released by Citizen Lab researchers on Tuesday. The group sent highly targeted phishing emails to its targets from a range of email accounts, including Gmail accounts and self-hosted accounts. The use of URL shorteners for masking phishing sites is a staple for the group - researchers said that over 16 months, they observed 28 unique URL shortener services that were operated by Dark Basin. "We later determined that all but two recipients of the leaked January email were also Dark Basin targets." Researchers said that they believe that in at least one case, Dark Basin repurposed a stolen internal email to re-target other individuals - leading them to conclude that Dark Basin had "Some success" in gaining access to the email accounts of one or more advocacy groups.
