International biotechnology company Miltenyi Biotec says it has fully recovered from a malware attack that affected parts of its network over the past couple of weeks. In an official statement, Miltenyi Biotec announced that, over the past couple of weeks, it experienced malware attacks that affected some of its order processing capabilities. "During the last two weeks, there have been isolated cases where order processing was impaired by malware in parts of our global IT infrastructure," the company says. It points out that it is not aware of customers or partners being affected by the malware attack. The company did not provide additional information on the nature of the attack, but it appears that the Mount Locker ransomware gang might have been responsible - they claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month. The gang claims to have stolen more than 1GB of documents from Miltenyi Biotec. SecurityWeek has contacted Miltenyi Biotec for additional information on the attack and will update the article when a reply arrives.
