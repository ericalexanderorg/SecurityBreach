AMD admitted that a hacker that goes online with the moniker "Palesa" has stolen source code files related to some of its graphics products, but it downplayed the potential impact of the hack. The hacker claims to have obtained files related to several AMD graphics processing units, including the Navi 10 architecture and the upcoming Navi 21, and Arden. "In December 2019, we were contacted by someone who claimed to have test files related to a subset of our current and future graphics products, some of which were recently posted online, but have since been taken down," reada a statement published by AMD. "While we are aware the perpetrator has additional files that have not been made public, we believe the stolen graphics IP is not core to the competitiveness or security of our graphics products. We are not aware of the perpetrator possessing any other AMD IP.". Palesa claims to have stolen the files directly from AMD, he plans to sell them to the highest bidder, he claims to have already received offers between $50,000 and $100,000. The offers are not enough for the hacker, he told TorrentFreak that he valued the source at $100M. Palesa also shared some of the stolen files on GitHub, but they were quickly removed as a result of a DMCA takedown request filed by vendor. "The alleged leaker further told us that one"source code packet" had already been released.
