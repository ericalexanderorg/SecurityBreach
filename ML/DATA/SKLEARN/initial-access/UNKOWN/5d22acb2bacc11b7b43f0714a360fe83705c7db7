In March, the University of California announced it was the victim of a ransomware attack. On January 12, 2021, Accellion issued a statement stating it had been aware of a P0 vulnerability in its legacy FTA software since mid-December. In early February, Accellion stated it had notified all affected FTA customers by December 23, 2020. In March, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation stated it had noticed a recent increase in PYSA ransomware targeting higher education, K-12 and seminaries in 12 US states and the U.K. Meanwhile, Accellion developed a tool that allows clients to check for indications of attack activity. Accellion has been encouraging its customers to abandon FTA which reaches its end of life on April 30 and switch to the Accellion Kiteworks content firewall which was not affected by the cyberattack. According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, bad actors have exploited the FTA vulnerabilities worldwide to attack multiple federal and state, local, tribal, and territorial government organizations as well as private industry organizations including those in the medical, legal, telecommunications, finance, and energy sectors. Every incident response plan should include ransomware.
