A faction of the Magecart threat group, Magecart group 12, has been linked to a recent digital card skimmer attack bent on stealing payment data from a slew of websites, including ones selling anything from Olympic tickets to emergency preparation kits. Over the past few weeks, the group has targeted two ticket sales websites - one called Olympic Tickets is a re-seller of tickets to the upcoming 2020 summer Olympic games and the second, Euro 2020 Tickets, is selling tickets for the 2020 UEFA, a European football championship that takes place in June. Researchers also found the group's same skimming code used to target popular emergency preparedness sites; BePrepared.com, which sells survival kits and gear, and Augason Farms, which sells emergency food supplies. "These sites were compromised by a skimmer using the domain OpenDoorCDN.com for data exfiltration," said Jordan Herman, threat researcher with RiskIQ in a Friday analysis. Researchers first became aware of the infection of the Olympic and UEFA ticket sale websites Jan. 17, after finding web skimming script on both of their check-out pages. Researchers said they don't have indication how many people were impacted by this wave of card skimmer attacks; however, BePrepared.com is currently ranked by Alexa at 129,204 globally and 26,238 in the U.S. Augasonfarms.com meanwhile is ranked 100,908 globally and 17,793 in the U.S. Based on the skimming code and obfuscation techniques used, researchers were able to link this attack back to Magecart Group 12, one of several groups operating under the Magecart umbrella. "This allows them to avoid detection because it is difficult to blacklist every one of their domains or get them taken down by their hosting providers. This is the first time I have directly observed a group swapping out skimming domains on compromised sites due to a takedown, but I expect it is not uncommon and shows how slippery Magecart can be."
