You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies. Credit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze.
