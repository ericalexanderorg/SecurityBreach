Portugal's energy giant Energias de Portugal fell victim to a ransomware attack this week, with hackers threatening to leak more than 10 terabytes of sensitive company information unless the firm pays the equivalent of US$11 million in bitcoin. "We had downloaded more than 10TB of private information from EDP group servers," said the attackers who are using the Ragnar Locker ransomware to extort the Portuguese energy giant for money, BleepingComputer reports. The cyber attackers have posted a note for EDP saying they had stolen information about clients, transactions, and contracts, among others, and had encrypted the systems of the company, BleepingComputer has found. The company is the world's fourth-largest wind energy producer, and nearly 66 percent of its energy is produced from renewable sources, it says on its website. This is not the first time an energy company has been held to ransom by cyber attackers. At the end of last year, Mexico's state oil firm Pemex was hit by a ransomware attack, which caused administrative operations at the company to grind to a halt, but work was restored soon after. Pemex has no intention of paying the ransom that cyber attackers have requested, Mexico's Energy Minister and Pemex board chair Rocio Nahle said a day later after the ransomware attack.
