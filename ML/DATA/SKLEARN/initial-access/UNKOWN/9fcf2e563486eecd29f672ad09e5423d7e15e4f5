UPDATE: Coincheck has detailed its compensation policy for customers whose XEM was stolen. To recap: Coincheck confirmed Friday that the hack, now likely the largest ever in the space, occurred on its servers early afternoon local time in Tokyo. Neither Coincheck nor XEM are as systemically important as Gox and bitcoin were four years ago. Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, calculated that the Mt. Gox hack represented roughly 5 percent of all crypto assets' aggregate network value at the time. In contrast, the Coincheck theft represents less than 0.25 percent of the aggregate value, meaning "The impact of the Mt. Gox hack was more than an order of magnitude greater on the crypto markets at the time," he said. Another difference is that the Coincheck customers have some hope of being repaid, whereas most of the bitcoins stolen from Gox were never recovered and its users were not made whole. During a press conference Friday, Coincheck executives indicated customers would be compensated for their stolen crypto, though it is unclear at this time whether they would be fully reimbursed.
