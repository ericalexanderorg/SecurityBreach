Maze ransomware operators have published credit card data stolen from the Bank of Costa Rica. In a post on their "Leak" site this week, Maze operators shared a 2GB spreadsheet with payment card numbers from customers of Banco de Costa Rica. Several screenshots from the database accompany the announcement, showing unencrypted credit card numbers. Bank identification number details showed that they were Visa or MasterCard debit cards issued by BCR. It should be noted that one of the card validation sites states that the validity of a number does not guarantee that it is also in use. The bank issued a public statement that day saying that following an "Exhaustive verification" they can "Firmly confirm that the institution's systems have not been violated." The bank issued another statement on May 22 reiterating that multiple analyses from internal and external specialists confirmed that the systems were not accessed without authorization and that clients' transactions were not impacted. At the beginning of the month, Maze told BleepingComputer that they reached out to the bank multiple times with a ransom demand and that they may sell the card data on the dark web.
