June 07, 2021 - A cyberattack on the University of Florida Health The Villages Regional Hospital and Leesburg Hospital has driven clinicians to EHR downtime procedures as its leadership investigates the ongoing attack, which is suspected to be caused by ransomware, according to local news outlet Villages-News. To protect its systems, access has been suspended to system platforms, including those between all UF Health hospitals and the University of Florida campus. "These types of situations take time to fully resolve," said Frank Faust, a UF Health spokesman said in a statement. There have been no updates provided outside of the sparse media reports, and the UF Health website remains online, unaffected by the attack. The UF Health attack and network outage is approximately the fourth health system ransomware-related outage and among a host of other attacks against critical infrastructure attacks in the last month. In healthcare, Ireland's Health Service Executive and New Zealand hospitals are still struggling to recover network access after falling victim to ransomware several weeks ago. Scripps Health, which was the first of the health systems to report ransomware-related outages, brought its systems back online last week.
