The Mariposa and the Royal Street Caf√© in Deer Valley, Colo., are informing customers that their payment card information may have been compromised after an unauthorized party hacked the point-of-sale system of a resort operator that runs both restaurants. The two Deer Valley Resort restaurants discovered on May 17 that an unauthorized person had gained access to their payment card system from January 10-28. During that period, cardholders' names, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and internal verification codes were read off their payment cards' magnetic strips. Deer Valley Resort said that once the intrusion was detected, the malware was removed, outside cybersecurity and law enforcement were called in to help, and the banks that issue the payment cards involved were informed so that each could initiate heightened monitoring. The company did not release how many people may have been affected by the breach.
