A Colorado company that specializes in providing IT services to dental offices suffered a ransomware attack this week that is disrupting operations for more than 100 dentistry practices, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Multiple sources affected say their IT provider, Englewood, Colo. based Complete Technology Solutions, was hacked, allowing a potent strain of ransomware known as "Sodinokibi" or "rEvil" to be installed on computers at more than 100 dentistry businesses that rely on the company for a range of services - including network security, data backup and voice-over-IP phone service. The attack on CTS comes little more than two months after Sodinokibi hit Wisconsin-based dental IT provider PerCSoft, an intrusion that encrypted files for approximately 400 dental practices. Thomas Terronez, CEO of Iowa-based Medix Dental, said he's heard from several affected practices that the attackers are demanding $700,000 in bitcoin from some of the larger victims to receive a key that can unlock files encrypted by the ransomware. In previous ransomware attacks, the assailants appear to have priced their ransom demands based on the number of workstation and/or server endpoints within the victim organization. Terronez said he's spoken with multiple other practices that have been sidelined by the ransomware attack, and that some CTS clients had usable backups of their data available off-site, while others have been working with third party companies to independently negotiate and pay the ransom for their practice only. Terronez said the dental industry in general has fairly atrocious security practices, and that relatively few offices are willing to spend what's needed to fend off sophisticated attackers.
