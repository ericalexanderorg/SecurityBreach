Cyble Research Team analyzed the leaked files included in a first batch of documents released by the group. The first archive of files allegedly stolen by the company is around 15.7 GB in size, the ransomware operators leaked a total of 16,805 company's files. The ransomware gang is now threatening the company of releasing other stolen data if it will not pay the ransom.
