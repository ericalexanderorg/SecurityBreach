Public Information Officer Jackie Broach said that just like hurricane or tornado, a cyber disaster hit the county on January 22 in the form of a ransomware attack.

Georgetown County Human Resources Director Walt Ackerman answered questions from Georgetown County's Council during last week's meeting. The experts we talked to say more communities should consider such cyber investments now to prevent disasters in the future.
