Montreal's west end health agency, the CIUSSS du Centre-Ouest-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, is only now beginning to go back online after a cyberattack last month forced it to disconnect from the internet. The health agency, which includes the Jewish General Hospital, said patient care wasn't affected when it first announced the attack October 29th. A statement released today by the health agency suggests key information systems have been offline for weeks. "The alert said malicious groups were targeting the sector with attacks that produce"data theft and disruption of health-care services. Last month, around the same time the CIUSSS was targeted, the website of Montreal's Transit Agency, the Société de transport de Montréal, was knocked offline by hackers who demanded a ransom payment of $2.8 million. The STM didn't pay the ransom, and payroll and adapted transit service as well as its website were affected for a week before the agency was able to get back online. Thériault said the health agency has been coping with the shutdown by using 'alternate workflows' including 'paper charting' of patient information. Health Minister Christian Dubé praised the health agency's response at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.
