P&N Bank has notifed customers of a data breach that resulted in a large amount of sensitive information being compromised. The affected system, P&N says in the notice, stored a great deal of personally identifiable information, as well as other sensitive data, including names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, customer numbers, age, account numbers and balance, and other details, which the bank refers to as non-sensitive. Passwords, birthdate, health information, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, social security numbers, tax file numbers, and credit card numbers were not included in the breach, the bank says. The bank also says that, because its core banking system is completely isolated from the impacted system, the data breach did not cause the loss of customer funds, that credit card details were not accessed, and that banking passwords were not exposed. The bank says it has been working with West Australian Police Force, the involved hosting provider, expert advisers, and regulators on investigating the breach. The bank has yet to provide information on the type of attack it fell victim to and the number of affected customers. "The cyber incident at P&N Bank illustrates how organizations can be susceptible to data breaches through their third parties. In this case, the bank was performing a server upgrade when attackers stole data through a hosting provider," Elad Shapira, Head of Research for Panorays, told SecurityWeek in an emailed comment.
