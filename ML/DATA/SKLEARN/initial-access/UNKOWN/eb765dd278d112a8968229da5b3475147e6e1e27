Exclusive The maker of vehicle license plate readers used extensively by the US government and cities to identify and track citizens and immigrants has been hacked. Its internal files were pilfered, and are presently being offered for free on the dark web to download. Tennessee-based Perceptics prides itself as "The sole provider of stationary LPRs installed at all land border crossing lanes for POV traffic in the United States, Canada, and for the most critical lanes in Mexico." Perceptics recently announced, in a pact with Unisys Federal Systems, it had landed "a key contract by US Customs and Border Protection to replace existing LPR technology, and to install Perceptics next generation License Plate Readers at 43 US Border Patrol check point lanes in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California." On Thursday this week an individual using the pseudonym "Boris Bullet-Dodger" contacted The Register, alerting us to the hack, and provided a list of files exfiltrated from Perceptics' corporate network as proof. Many of the image files, we're guessing, are license plate captures. The stolen files amount to hundreds of gigabytes and include Microsoft Exchange and Access databases, ERP databases, HR records, Microsoft SQL Server data stores, and so on. With the CityComp hack, stolen files were released because a ransom was not paid; we have yet to determine whether a ransom was sought for the Perceptics files.
