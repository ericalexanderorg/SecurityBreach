RailWorks Corporation, one of North America's leading railroad track and transit system providers, disclosed a ransomware attack that led to the exposure of personally identifiable information of current and former employees, their beneficiaries and dependents, as well as that of independent contractors. BleepingComputer reached out to a RailWorks spokesperson for comment and to confirm the ransomware attack but did not hear back at the time of publication. BleeingComputer has been saying for a while now that ransomware attacks should be considered data breaches. RailWorks' might be the first company that files a data breach notification after such an incident, something that we've been long expecting. This will most likely happen more often in the coming months, as lawmakers will likely take notice of the full effects ransomware attacks have on a victim and pass legislation requiring orgs to file data breach notifications following such incidents. Harvesting their victims' data before encrypting systems and then threatening to slowly leak out the stolen data in stages is a new method used by ransomware gangs to pressure victims to give in and pay the ransom. This distressing trend for companies that fall victim to ransomware attacks was started by Maze Ransomware during late November 2019 and was embraced by the operators of other ransomware families including Sodinokibi, Nemty Ransomware, and BitPyLock last month.
