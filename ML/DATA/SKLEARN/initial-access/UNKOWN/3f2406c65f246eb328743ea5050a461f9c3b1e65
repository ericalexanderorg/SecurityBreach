Skimmers attributed to MAGECART GROUP 12 were previously found loading a JavaScript skimmer from pathc. Txt, however new variants show a shift to loading the skimmer from toolser. This PHP malware is injected into the Magento 1.x file app/Mage. If all variable checks are met, then the PHP code will download the JavaScript skimmer, which is also obfuscated by having its text reversed and then encoded. The deobfuscation is handled by the PHP functions base64 decode and strrev on the results of the curl download. php. <?php /** * Magento * * NOTICE OF LICENSE * * This source file is subject to the Open Software License * that is bundled with this package in the file LICENSE.txt.
