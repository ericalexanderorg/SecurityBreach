Switzerland's Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance today warned of ongoing ransomware attacks targeting the systems of Swiss small, medium-sized, and large companies. According to the alert issued in collaboration with the Swiss Government Computer Emergency Response Team, the attackers have asked for ransoms ranging from thousands of Swiss Francs to millions - 1 million CHF is just over $1 million. Swiss ransomware victims ignored warnings, had poor security. As MELANI and GovCERT discovered while investigating these ransomware incidents, recommended best practices such as MELANI's information security checklist for SMEs were not implemented by the victims and previous warnings of such attacks were not taken into consideration. Last year, in November, a confidential report issued by the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre said that at least 1,800 companies from around the globe and with operations in various industry sectors were affected by ransomware attacks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also warned private sector partners last month about Maze Ransomware operators focusing their attacks on US companies. Yesterday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency alerted organizations across all critical U.S. infrastructure sectors of a recent ransomware attack that hit a natural gas compression facility and took down pipeline operations for two days.
