A threat actor has hacked into the Chowbus food delivery service and emailed links to the stolen data to all customers. Chowbus is a mobile-based Asian food delivery service that allows customers to order food from local restaurants in cities around the USA, Australia, and Canada. At 1:33 a.m. yesterday, Chowbus customers began receiving mysterious emails titled "Chowbus data," which simply stated, "Download Chowbus data here." Included in the email were download links to both a user and restaurant database used by the food delivery service. In an email to customers, Chowbus explained that they are investigating the hack, but none of the exposed data contained financial information or passwords. "At approximately 1:30 a.m. CDT on October 5, Chowbus learned that some of our user data had been illegally accessed and made available online. As soon as we became aware of this incident, our security team quickly took steps to start addressing the issue." "Thankfully, the data did not contain credit card information or Chowbus account passwords, and we are confident that this information is safe," the Chowbus data breach notification stated. If you are a ChowBus customer, you can check if your information was exposed in the breach by using the Have I Been Pwned data breach notification site.
