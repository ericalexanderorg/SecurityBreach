As Business Insider reports, Palo Alto Networks has suffered a data breach. According to the report, Palo Alto Networks confirmed to Business Insider that the personal details of seven current and former employees had been "Inadvertently" published online by a "Third-party vendor" in February. Palo Alto Networks has declined to name the vendor concerned, or provide details of where on the internet the data appeared, but it has said that it has terminated the contract of their careless vendor. We would all like to think that the companies we work for would put robust demands on those external firms that provide products and services that they will be careful with our data - whether it be information about our products and services, intellectual property, customers, or employees. Palo Alto Networks clearly took the latter approach - and that's understandable as it wants to send a clear message to its own staff and future external contractors that it simply will not accept a sloppy attitude to security. There is one other step that Palo Alto Networks could take, which they have chosen not to take. Let's not forget that if a third-party is providing services to Palo Alto Networks there's a good chance that they are also providing similar services to other firms.
