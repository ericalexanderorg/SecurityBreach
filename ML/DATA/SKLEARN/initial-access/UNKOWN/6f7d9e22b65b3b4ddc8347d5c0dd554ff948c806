On 27 June 2017, GoGet's IT team identified suspected unauthorised activity on its system and a full internal investigation was immediately commenced. Although the investigation by NSW Police is ongoing, it appears that the suspect was accessing GoGet's systems in an attempt to use GoGet vehicles without permission. In the process, as part of his overall activity on the system, it also appears that the suspect has accessed personal information of GoGet's members and individuals who have previously attempted to create a GoGet account. The personal information accessed by the suspect depends on what information was provided to GoGet by the individual when they became, or attempted to become, a member. NSW Police are also investigating whether the suspect was responsible for installing software onto GoGet's systems to access payment card details of a small group of individuals when they signed up to the service through GoGet's website or updated their payment card details. GoGet's number one focus has been to protect its members and any affected individuals and retrieve information potentially accessed by the suspect to prevent any misuse of that information. Has GoGet notified the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner?
