From December 2018 until at least May of this year, the GRU hacker group known as APT28 or Fancy Bear carried out a broad hacking campaign against US targets, according to an FBI notification sent to victims of the breaches in May and obtained by WIRED. According to the FBI, the GRU hackers primarily attempted to break into victims' mail servers, Microsoft Office 365 and email accounts, and VPN servers. The targets included "a wide range of US based organizations, state and federal government agencies, and educational institutions," the FBI notification states. Technical breadcrumbs included in that notice reveal that APT28 hackers have targeted the US energy sector, too, apparently as part of the same effort. The revelation of a potentially ongoing US-targeted GRU hacking spree is especially troubling in light of the GRU's past operations, which have often gone beyond mere espionage to include embarrassing email leaks or even disruptive cyberattacks. APT28 hackers in particular have been the subject of US indictments alleging hack-and-leak operations targeting both the 2016 US election and the Worldwide Anti-doping Agency. According to the FBI's victim notification, the APT28 hackers have gained access to networks via spear-phishing emails sent to both personal and work email accounts. Within days of the FBI's notification being sent to victims in early May, the NSA issued a public advisory that Sandworm, a separate but closely linked GRU hacker group, was exploiting a vulnerability in Exim mail servers to target victims.
