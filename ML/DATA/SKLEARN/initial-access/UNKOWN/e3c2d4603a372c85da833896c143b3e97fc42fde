Nintendo said over 160,000 accounts have been hacked, due to attackers abusing a legacy login system. Over the past few weeks, Nintendo gamers have been reporting suspicious activities on their accounts. According to the complaints, aired out on Twitter and Reddit, unauthorized actors were logging into victims' accounts and abusing the payment cards connected to the accounts to buy digital goods on Nintendo's online stores, such as V-Bucks, in-game currency used in Fortnite. In a Friday statement, Nintendo said that attackers have been abusing its NNID legacy login system since the beginning of April to hack into the accounts. This is different from a Nintendo account, which is used for the Nintendo Switch. "Users will be notified by email to reset your Nintendo Network ID and Nintendo account," according to the translated version of the statement. "If you have already logged into your Nintendo account via your Nintendo Network ID, please log in using your registered Nintendo account email address or login ID.".
