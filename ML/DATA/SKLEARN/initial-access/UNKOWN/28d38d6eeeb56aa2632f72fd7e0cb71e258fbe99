We are asking users to change their password on Docker Hub and any other accounts that shared this password. If you have received a password reset link, your password hash was potentially exposed. A password reset link has been sent to any users who potentially had their password hash exposed. No. If your password hash was potentially exposed, we have invalidated your password and emailed you a reset password link. Even if you did not receive a password reset link, it's never a bad idea to change your password if you haven't changed it in a while. We have sent a password reset link to each user whose password hash may have been impacted. If your password hash was potentially exposed, we have invalidated it and sent you a password reset link as a precaution.
