Montgomery County officials say their computer systems are back up and operational, after a brief weekend outage. Communications director Michelle Newell said the county network was impacted by a data security incident over the weekend, which prevented access to the county network. Newell said they immediately implemented response protocols and an investigation utilizing both law enforcement and cybersecurity experts. She said most services were back online by Saturday evening, with everything restored as of Monday morning. Newell said they don't know of any negative impacts to the network, and are now looking to further enhance their existing online security posture. Montgomery County Mayor Jim Durrett said he knows the episode presented problems. "We understand this has been an inconvenience for our community and our employees. However, it is in our best interest to rely on experts who specialize in these types of incidents," said Durrett.
