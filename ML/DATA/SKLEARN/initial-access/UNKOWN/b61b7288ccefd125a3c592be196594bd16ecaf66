A cyberattack on Chenango County government computers is not expected to interfere with regular operations, including elections, according to county officials. The attackers - likely based in Hong Kong, according to an investigation by the New York state Department of Homeland Security - are demanding $450 for the release of each machine, Ericksen said, totaling around $90,000. In his nearly 35 years with the department, Ericksen said he had never seen a cyberattack of this nature before. With the presidential election less than three weeks away at the time of the attack and early voting starting in just six days, the Board of Elections was the county's first priority to get back online, Ericksen said. Ballot counters, poll pads and ballot-on-demand printers so far remain functional, according to Democratic Elections Commissioner Carol Franklin, so the Board of Elections is continuing to accept absentee ballots and those completed in-person through early voting, but the department cannot process or produce any reports except the number of ballots it has received. While about 2,000 Chenango County voters submit absentee ballots in an average election year, the county has already received well over 5,000, Franklin said. Franklin assured voters that Chenango County's election results will not be compromised as a result of the cyber attack.
