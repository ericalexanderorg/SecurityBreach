Aptoide has been one popular app store for Android users, but recently it's suffered a huge data breach. ZDNet worked with data breach monitoring service Under The Breach to uncover details relating to Aptoide's data breach which exposed details for 20 million Android users. The data includes "Personal identifiable information" including the user's email address, real name, sign-up data and IP address, device details, and even a date of birth for millions of users. If you signed up for Aptoide between the dates of July 21st, 2016 and January 28th, 2018, your data may have been exposed in this breach. 20 million users is far from Aptoide's claimed 150 million userbase, but it's still a concerning breach of data. Making matters worse, this leak of 20 million users was only a part of a larger breach that exposed data of 39 million users. Notably, Aptoide has previously accused Google of treating the app store "Unfairly" by using Google Play Protect to put a security warning on the app or even uninstall it from a user's device.
