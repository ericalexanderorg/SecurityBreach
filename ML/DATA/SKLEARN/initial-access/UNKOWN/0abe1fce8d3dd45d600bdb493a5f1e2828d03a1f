The personal information of roughly 3.1 million Toyota customers may have been leaked following a security breach of multiple Toyota and Lexus sales subsidiaries, as detailed in a breach notification issued by the car maker today. As detailed in a press release published on Toyota'a global newsroom, unauthorized access was detected on the computing systems of Tokyo Sales Holdings, Tokyo Tokyo Motor, Tokyo Toyopet, Toyota Tokyo Corolla, Nets Toyota Tokyo, Lexus Koishikawa Sales, Jamil Shoji, and Toyota West Tokyo Corolla. Toyota has not yet confirmed if the attackers were able to exfiltrate any of the customer personal information exposed after the IT systems of its subsidiaries were breached. "We apologize to everyone who has been using Toyota and Lexus vehicles for the great concern," states Toyota's notification. "We take this situation seriously, and will thoroughly implement information security measures at dealers and the entire Toyota Group." This breach comes after Australian Toyota dealers were also targeted by a cyber attack which led to multiple corporate IT systems going down on February 19. A chat with a Toyota Australia dealership employee leads to a reexamination of the impacts & motives of their recent breach.
