The food delivery company said in a blog post Thursday that 4.9 million customers, delivery workers and merchants had their information stolen by hackers. The breach happened at some point before May 4, 2019, the company said, but added that customers who joined after April 5, 2018 are not affected by the breach. It's not clear why it took four months for DoorDash to publicly reveal the breach. Around 100,000 delivery workers also had their driver's license information stolen in the breach. The news comes almost exactly a year after DoorDash customers complained that their accounts had been hacked. The company at the time denied a data breach and claimed attackers were running credential stuffing attacks, in which hackers take lists of stolen usernames and passwords and try them on other sites that may use the same credentials. Many of the customers we spoke to said their passwords were unique to DoorDash.
