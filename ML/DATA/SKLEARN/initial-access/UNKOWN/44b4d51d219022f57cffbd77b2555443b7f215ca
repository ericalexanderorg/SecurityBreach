French multinational production and distribution firm Banijay Group SAS was hit earlier this month by a DoppelPaymer ransomware attack and had sensitive information stolen by the ransomware operators during the incident. "Banijay is currently managing a cyber incident involving the pre-existing Endemol Shine Group and Endemol Shine International networks," the group said. While Banijay has only shared that they have suffered a cyber-attack and that some of their data might have been compromised, the DoppelPaymer ransomware gang is claiming to be responsible. As proof of the their involvement in the attack, the DoppelPaymer operators have shared several documents presumably stolen from Banijay's systems, a tactic adopted from Maze Ransomware starting with February 2020. DoppelPaymer is a ransomware operation known for hitting enterprise targets since at least mid-June 2019 by gaining access to admin credentials and using them to deploy the ransomware payloads to all devices after compromising the entire network. In November 2019, Mexico's state-owned oil company PEMEX was hit by DoppelPaymer and was asked to pay $4.9 million worth of bitcoins as a ransom. Update: Added DoppelPaymer ransomware info and updated title.
