Survey company Typeform has admitted suffering a breach caused by attackers downloading a "Partial backup" of its customer data. Each one of those collects data from possibly tens of thousands of their own customers when they take part, which widens the breach's scope. Each affected provider will therefore need to contact these customers independently - a situation that draws parallels with the breach suffered by email marketing provider Epsilon in 2011, which saw dozens of large brands sending out apology emails. Our initial investigations suggest that some personal data of about 20,000 people is likely to have been included in the breach. Typeform is vague about specifics, choosing to mention only what isn't at risk, namely subscription payment data, Typeform account passwords, any payments collected via Stripe integration, and audience payment data. Which brings us to the coalface of this breach - the unknown number of people who have never heard of Typeform, nor realised their data was being stored by them, but who might receive alert emails from the business that used it. If you're unlucky enough to be one of these, it seems the risk is, as stated, receiving phishing scams, that might use personal data from the breach to try to lure you in.
