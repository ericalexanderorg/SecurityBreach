Sports data provider Stats Perform has been down for almost a week thanks to a ransomware hack, Legal Sports Report understands. The Stats platform went down last Saturday during the college football slate, causing issues at daily fantasy sports sites including FanDuel, DraftKings and others. DraftKings was able to switch to a backup stats provider for NFL Sunday, but FanDuel was forced to settle its NFL contests manually mid-week and issue refunds. The team continues onboarding the new stat provider. We are still tracking to have live stats up and running for nfl by Sunday. Following the outage, Stats Perform has spent the week rebuilding the servers. This is the latest information we have received from STATS Perform.
