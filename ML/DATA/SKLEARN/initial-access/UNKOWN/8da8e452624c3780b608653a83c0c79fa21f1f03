Six facilities were hit in an Iranian cyberattack last month on the country's water infrastructure that succeeded in impacting some systems but did not cause any disruption in the water supply or waste management, the Ynet news site reported on Tuesday. At one of the Israel Water Authority facilities, an "Irregularity due to an unplanned change in data" was recorded, the report said. The Water Authority and Israel National Cyber Directorate identified the series of cyber incidents on April 24-25. The water authority's cybersecurity chief told Ynet that none of the incidents caused damage or affected water supplies or wastewater management. The Water Authority and the National Cyber Directorate confirmed earlier this month an "Attempted cyber breach on water command and control systems." "The attempted attack was dealt with by the Water Authority and National Cyber Directorate. It should be emphasized that there was no harm to the water supply and it operated, and continues to operate, without interruption," it said. Israel was reportedly aghast at the Iranian attack on its water infrastructure.
