Cold storage giant Americold is currently dealing with a cyberattack impacting their operations, including phone systems, email, inventory management, and order fulfillment. Americold is a leading temperature-controlled warehouses operator who offers supply-chain services and inventory management for retailers, food service providers, and producers. Americold manages 183 warehouses worldwide and has approximately 13,000 employees.

"On November 16, 2020, Americold Realty Trust determined that its computer network was affected by a cybersecurity incident. As a precautionary measure, the Company took immediate steps to help contain the incident and implemented business continuity plans, where appropriate, to continue ongoing operations.
