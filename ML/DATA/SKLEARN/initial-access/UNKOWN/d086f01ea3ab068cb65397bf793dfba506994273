Personal details from resumes and CVs from job seekers were exposed after a server belonging to a recruitment company that was a customer of Monster.com and others was left unprotected. Monster.com which learned of the breach in August, did not initially alert potential victims to the exposure, contending that notification responsibly lay with the recruitment company that "Owned" the data. "Customers that purchase access to Monster's data - candidate résumés and CVs - become the owners of the data and are responsible for maintaining its security," Monster Chief Privacy Officer Michael Jones said in a statement cited by TechCrunch. "In today's era of growing privacy regulations, how companies react in the wake of a data breach is critical, said Peter Goldstein, CTO and co-founder of Valimail." "Monster might have paid careful attention to their internal security practices, but still the data that they are responsible for has been exposed," said Pankaj Parekh, chief product and strategy officer at SecurityFirst. "The exposed resumes give cybercriminals more than enough data to commit phishing attacks and effective impersonation attempts, which can lead to account takeover, identity theft and other scams," said Goldstein. "At least give people a slice of the action when you sell their data."
