Special Olympics of New York, a nonprofit organization focused on competitive athletes with intellectual disabilities, had its email server hacked around this year's Christmas holiday and later used to launch a phishing campaign against previous donors. Special Olympics NY provides sports training and athletic competition to more than 67,000 children and adults with intellectual disabilities across New York State. "As you may have noticed, our email server was temporarily hacked. We have fixed the problem and send our sincerest apologies," Stacey Hengsterman, President & CEO of Special Olympics NY said in an Instagram post on December 27. "Please be assured that your contact information is protected and has been kept confidential," the Special Olympics NY notification also stated. Using such a short time frame allowed the phishers to induce a sense of urgency designed to make the Special Olympics NY donors click on one of the two embedded hyperlinks, links that would supposedly redirect them to a PDF version of the transaction statement. As part of the Twitter thread announcing the hack, SVP of External Relations for Special Olympics NY Casey Vattimo says that donors can now make donations securely as the issue has now been fixed. All amounts donated to Special Olympics NY through December 31 will be tripled courtesy of Finish Line.
