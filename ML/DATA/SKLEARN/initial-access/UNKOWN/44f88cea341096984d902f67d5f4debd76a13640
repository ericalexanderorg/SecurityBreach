Days before Judge Amy Coney Barrett was nominated to the Supreme Court, the website of the People of Praise was hacked, CNA has learned. Amid speculation regarding Barrett's possible appointment, numerous media reports focused on the People of Praise, the Indiana-based ecumenical charismatic community to which Barrett reportedly belongs. People of Praise was also criticized by some pundits because it does not disclose its membership, which defenders say is a common policy among religious organizations. While the People of Praise declined to speculate about who might have been responsible for the hack, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNA that some "Community members were contacted by national media outlets within 36 hours of the [database] incursion," which the source called an "Alarming coincidence." People of Praise was founded in 1971 as part of the era's "Great emergence of lay ministries and lay movements in the Catholic Church," Bishop Peter Smith, who belongs to an affiliated association of Catholic priests, told CNA in 2018. While most People of Praise members are Catholic, the group is officially ecumenical; people from a variety of Christian denominations can join. Correction: The People of Praise originally told CNA the date of the hack was Sept. 23.
