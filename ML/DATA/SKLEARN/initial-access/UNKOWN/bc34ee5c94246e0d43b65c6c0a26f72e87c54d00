After a deadline was missed for receiving a ransom payment, the group behind Maze Ransomware has published almost 700 MB worth of data and files stolen from security staffing firm Allied Universal. This email was signed from the 'Maze Crew' and was about how they breached a large security staffing company named Allied Universal, who employs approximately 200,000 people and has revenues of over $7 billion USD. "I am writing to you because we have breached Allied Universal security firm, downloaded data and executed Maze ransomware in their network." When we contacted Allied Universal to not only get a statement, but to also warn them about the Maze crew's threats. "Allied Universal is aware of a situation that may involve unauthorized access to our systems. We take any situation of this nature very seriously. This incident is being thoroughly investigated by Allied Universal IT experts who have taken immediate and appropriate actions to reinforce existing security measures and to mitigate any potential impact. We also have engaged outside cybersecurity experts to re-verify our system's security. Keeping our company data safe and that of our customers and employees is of paramount importance," Allied Universal told BleepingComputer in a statement. They further warned that if Allied Universal did not pay, the Maze actors would conduct a spam campaign using their Allied's domain name and email certificates. After a lack of negotiation occurring between Maze and Allied Universal, the Maze actors more pointedly indicated that BleepingComputer should publish a story about what was happening. This increased amount is highly unlikely, as Maze told us that in their negotiations with Allied Universal, the company said they would pay no more than $50,000 USD. Now that the data and breach had been publicly disclosed by the Maze actors, we contacted law enforcement, once again attempted to contact Allied without a response, and decided to write this article.
