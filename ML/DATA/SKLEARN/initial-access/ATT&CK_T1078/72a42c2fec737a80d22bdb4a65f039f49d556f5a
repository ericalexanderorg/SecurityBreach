Dutch ethical hacker Victor Gevers claims it only took five attempts to guess the password to President Donald Trump's Twitter account - "Maga2020!". Twitter Safety & 2FA. Twitter said it is dubious about the report. "We've seen no evidence to corroborate this claim, including from the article published in the Netherlands today," a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement responding to Threatpost's inquiries. "We proactively implemented account security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the United States, including federal branches of government." An announcement on Sept. 17 from Twitter Safety said the company was sending in-app notifications "Requiring" or "Strongly recommending" enhanced security measures, including a requirement for a strong password, to members of government and journalists in the run-up to the election. Gevers said that after he successfully hacked the president's Twitter account he went to great lengths to report the vulnerability, sending emails, screenshots and social-media messages to various U.S. government entities through Twitter, Parler and other platforms, de Volkskrant reported. In 2016, he was part of a group of self-described "Grumpy old hackers" who accessed Trump's Twitter account by guessing the password "Yourefired," Vrij Nederland reported.
