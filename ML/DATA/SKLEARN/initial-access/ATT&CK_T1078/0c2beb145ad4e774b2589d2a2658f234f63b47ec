According to a letter of warning sent out recently the Orange County, Calif., branch of the Girl Scouts experienced a data breach. The data breach, which is estimated to affect almost 3,000 members, occurred over the course of one day toward the end of September. An unknown third-party attacker was able to gain access to the email , which then allowed them to send numerous emails to various strategic locations. The data contained within these records include full legal birth names, home addresses, driver's license numbers, health history, and even insurance policy numbers. In the aftermath of the breach, the Girl Scouts of Orange County notified the attorney general in California of the incident. The letter also stated that the Girl Scouts went through their emails and deleted any that contained personal data. Finally, Christina Salcido stated that the Girl Scouts are beefing up their security by "Implementing a secure online system for Troop Travel forms," as well as other undisclosed security hardening efforts being developed with their IT team.
