In a report for the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, Bed Bath & Beyond retailer disclosed that an unauthorized party obtained login information for some of its customers. The amount of login information compromised as a result of this incident is limited, as the unnamed source could access less than 1% of Bed Bath & Beyond's online customer accounts. Although this security event is not expected to have a negative impact on operations and financial condition, Bed Bath & Beyond stock fell by 0.2% in after-hours trading, MarketWatch reports. Javvad Malik, Security Awareness Advocate at KnowBe4 told BleepingComputer that the source with access to the login data may have been compromised because an employee recycled their corporate credentials. Cybercriminals obtaining breach data often test it with various online services specifically because they know that many users re-use their login information. This is not the only security incident Bed Bath & Beyond had to deal with this year. At the beginning of May, the retailer notified its customers that a call center employee processing orders "May have attempted to illegally compromise customer credit card information."
