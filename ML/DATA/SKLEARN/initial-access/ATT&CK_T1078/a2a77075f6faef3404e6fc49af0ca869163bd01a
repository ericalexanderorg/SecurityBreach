A newly discovered APT group, dubbed Calypso after a custom malware RAT that it uses, has been targeting state institutions in six different countries since 2016. Once inside the network, the group injects a backdoor RAT program - the Calypso web shell - that it uses to execute commands and upload utilities and malware, all in an effort to move laterally. "These attacks succeeded largely because most of the utilities the group uses to move inside the network are widely used by the specialists everywhere for network administration," said Denis Kuvshinov, lead specialist in threat analysis at Positive Technologies, via email. "The group used publicly available utilities and exploit tools." As for attribution, PT said that its forensics indicate that the discovered APT group is likely to be of Asian origin and is Chinese-speaking. Further, the researchers noted that in one of the attacks the group used PlugX malware - traditionally used by many Chinese APT groups. "All data given here suggests that the group originates from Asia and uses malware not previously described by anyoneWe keep monitoring the activities of Calypso closely and expect the group will attack again."
