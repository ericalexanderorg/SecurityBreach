On January 3, 2018, Mailgun became aware of an incident in which a customer's API key was compromised and immediately began diagnostics to help determine the cause and the scope of impact. Mailgun has now completed its diagnostic of accounts that were affected and has notified each of the affected users. If you were not directly notified by Mailgun regarding this incident, then your account was not affected. Finally, we'd like to assure our customers and partners that we take security at Mailgun very seriously. Only a small subset of Mailgun accounts were impacted. If you did not receive a notification email, your account was not among those affected. If you were notified that your account was affected, we advise that you do the following to protect your account from unauthorized access: 1) Rotate your Mailgun API keys 2) Change your SMTP username and passwords.
