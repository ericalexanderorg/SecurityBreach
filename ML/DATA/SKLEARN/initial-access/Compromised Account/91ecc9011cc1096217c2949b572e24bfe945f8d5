A small number of HSBC online banking customers - less than 1% of accounts - were breached last month by unauthorized users, the bank acknowledged Tuesday. "We responded to this incident by fortifying our log-on and authentication processes, and implemented additional layers of security for digital and mobile access to all personal and business banking accounts. We have notified those customers whose accounts may have experienced unauthorized access, and are offering them one year of credit monitoring and identify theft protection service." "We are reminding our customers to protect access to their banking accounts by regularly changing their passwords, and by using unique passwords they are not using elsewhere, including on any social media accounts," Sherman said. When it detected the breach, HSBC suspended online access for affected accounts and required impacted customers to contact it. In 2015, HSBC notified mortgage customers of a data breach that had taken place the year before. Personal information about mortgage accounts was "Inadvertently made accessible via the Internet," including customers' names, Social Security numbers, account numbers, old account information and possibly some phone numbers, the bank said at that time. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation requires companies to disclose personal data breaches to regulators and affected customers within 72 hours of becoming aware of them.
