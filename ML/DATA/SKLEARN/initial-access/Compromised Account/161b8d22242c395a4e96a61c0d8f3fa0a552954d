The Justice Department has indicted two Iranian men behind the SamSam ransomware attacks - that infected the cities of Atlanta, San Diego and Newark, N.J. - as well as two others who converted the ransom into Iranian riyals. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, "Extorted victims by leaving a ransom note in the form of a file on each computer encrypted by SamSam Ransomware," read the indictment, unsealed Wednesday a U.S. District Court in New Jersey. A SamSam attack crippled a number of systems and services in Atlanta in March and the Port of San Diego in September. The focus on healthcare may be due to the attacker's impression that these will be easier targets, they cybergang behind SamSam does show a preference for easy hits, or that they are more likely to fork over the ransom. Grammatical errors were a clue that the attackers likely didn't speak English as a first language, the attacks didn't rely on the typical badly worded spam email with an attachment. Once the attackers received the ransom, two Bitcoin exchangers, identified by the Treasury Department as Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, turned it into Iranian riyals. "Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims. As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes," Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said in the release.
