US clothing retailer J.Crew announced that it was the victim of a credential stuffing attack around April 2019 that led to some of its customers' accounts and information being accessed by hackers. Credentials stuffing is a type of attack where hackers use large collections of username/password combinations bought from underground markets and leaked after previous security breaches and use them to gain access to user accounts on other online platforms. The rate of success of such attacks is highly dependent on the common practice of users using the same email and password for multiple online accounts. Their end goal is to log into as many accounts as possible onto the targeted site and take over the identities of the account owners, steal money, or gather information. In a notice of data breach sent to affected customers, J.Crew says that it discovered "Through routine and proactive web scanning" that an unauthorized party was able to log in to their jcrew.com accounts using their email addresses and passwords "In or around April 2019.". The company issued a security notification at the time notifying users of their DD Perks reward program that their accounts may have been compromised as part of a credential stuffing attack. The attackers might have been able to access the account holders' first and last names, their email address, and the 16-digit DD Perks account number and QR code.
