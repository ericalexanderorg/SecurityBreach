An unauthorized person was able to gain access to a TransUnion Canada web portal and use it to pull consumer credit files. BleepingComputer has learned that starting last week TransUnion Canada began sending out data security incident notifications via postal mail to consumers whose information was accessed via an unauthorized login. These notifications state that an unauthorized user utilized a TransUnion business portal to perform credit file lookups between June 28th and July 11th, 2019. "Trans Union of Canada, Inc is writing to let you know about a data security incident. Our customer, CWB National Leasing Inc.'s, has advised us that their access code to TransUnion systems may have been misappropriated and used to access information about you without authorization. Upon becoming aware of the incident, TransUnion commenced an investigation." "By way of background, TransUnion operates a portal through which our business customers can retrieve consumer credit files for permitted purposes. An unidentified person illegal obtained CWB National Leasing's access code and password to the portal, which has permitted access to some of TransUnion's credit file information between approximately June 28 and July 11, 2019. TransUnion has confirmed that the login credentials were terminated." "TransUnion continues to look for ways to further strengthen our defenses against unauthorized access of any kind to TransUnion data. Affected consumers should also take advantage of the two years of free credit and fraud monitoring services being offered by TransUnion as part of this security incident.
