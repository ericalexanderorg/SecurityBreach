Gentoo Developers & Infrastructure escalated to GitHub support and the Gentoo Organization was frozen by GitHub staff. The Gentoo Proxy Maintainers Project was impacted as many proxy-maint contributors use GitHub to submit PRs. All past pull requests were apparently disconnected from their original commits and closed. The main Gentoo repositories are kept on Gentoo hosted infrastructure and Gentoo mirrors to GitHub in order to "Be where the contributors are." We do not believe the private keys of the account impacted were at risk, and so the gentoo-hosted infrastructure was not impacted by this incident.
