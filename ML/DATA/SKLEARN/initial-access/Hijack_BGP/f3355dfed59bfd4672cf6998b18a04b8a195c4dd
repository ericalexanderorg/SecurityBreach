Between 11am until 1pm UTC today, DNS traffic - the phone book of the internet, routing you to your favourite websites - was hijacked by an unknown actor. The attackers used BGP - a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world - to reroute traffic to Amazon's Route 53 service, the largest commercial cloud provider who count major websites such as Twitter.com as customers. So far the only known website to have traffic redirected was to MyEtherWallet.com, a cryptocurrency website. The attacks only gained a relatively small amount of currency from MyEtherWallet.com - however their wallets in total already contained over Â£20m of currency. Mounting an attack of this scale requires access to BGP routers at major ISPs and real computing resource to deal with so much DNS traffic. The attackers failed to obtain an SSL certificate while man-in-the-middle attacking the traffic - a very easy process - which alerted people to the issue at scale. The security vulnerabilities in BGP and DNS are well known, and have been attacked before.
