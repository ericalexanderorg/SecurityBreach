Hundreds of thousands of documents with plastic surgery patients' personal information and highly sensitive photos were exposed online by an improperly secured Amazon Web Services S3 bucket. NextMotion is a French plastic surgery tech firm that provides imaging and patient management services that help 170 plastic surgery clinics from 35 countries document, digitize and market their practices. After analyzing the open S3 bucket discovered on January 24 in collaboration with vpnMentor more closely, security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar found outlines and invoices for cosmetic treatments, videos of 360-degree body and face scans, as well as patient photos that, in some cases, were graphic snapshots of genitals, breasts, and more. NextMotion's CEO said in a press release that the patient data stored in the leaky database "Had been de-identified - identifiers, birth dates, notes, etc. - and thus was not exposed." Previous incidents impacting plastic surgery patients. In 2017, the London Bridge Plastic Surgery clinic issued a data breach statement saying that The Dark Overlord hacking group was able to steal patient information and highly sensitive photos. The AZ Plastic Surgery Center notified 5,524 patients in February 2019 that some of their protected health information may have been accessed by TDO. Later last year, in early November 2019, The Center for Facial Restoration reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that the PII of up to 3,600 patients may have been stolen in a hacking incident.
