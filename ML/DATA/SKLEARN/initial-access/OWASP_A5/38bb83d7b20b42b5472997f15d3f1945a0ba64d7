A publicly accessible and unsecured ElasticSearch server owned by the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Department of the Chinese province Jiangsu leaked two databases containing over 90 million people and business records. Jiangsu is an eastern-central coastal Chinese province with a population of over 80 million and an urban population of more than 55 million accounting for 68.76% of its total population according to a 2018 population census from the National Bureau of Statistics, which makes it the fifth most populous province in China. Provincial public security departments are "Functional organization under the dual leadership of Provincial Government and the Ministry of Public Security in charge of the whole province's public security work." Besides the two exposed ElasticSearch databases, the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Department also had a Public Security Network admin console that required a valid user/password combo for access, as well as a publicly-accessible Kibana installation running on the server which would help browse and analyze the stored data using a GUI-based interface.
