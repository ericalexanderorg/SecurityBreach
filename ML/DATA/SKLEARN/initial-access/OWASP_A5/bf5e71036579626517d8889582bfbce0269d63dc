A Wisconsin mattress company leaked the records of 387,000 customers online in a database that lacked password protection, a security researcher has found. The incident once again demonstrates the potential security consequences of failing to take even the simplest security measures to protect company data. Further investigation found that every file contained references to Verlo Mattress Factory and "Appeared to be customer data," he said in a blog post about the incident on Thursday. The database set-which contains 387,604 records with names, phone numbers, emails, home addresses and billing addresses-was open and visible in any browser for anyone to edit, download or even delete data without administrative credentials, according to Fowler. Data found in the files also included login credentials with hashed passwords for internal users as well as IP addresses, ports, pathways and storage info that could allow potential cybercriminals deeper access to other network resources, he said. The latter was the case earlier this month, when cosmetics giant Yves Rocher exposed the personal data of millions of its customers and reams of sensitive internal company information to the public because of an online server left unprotected by a third-party consultant to the firm. "In today's world, it is not if a data breach will happen, it is a matter of when the data breach will happen," he wrote.
