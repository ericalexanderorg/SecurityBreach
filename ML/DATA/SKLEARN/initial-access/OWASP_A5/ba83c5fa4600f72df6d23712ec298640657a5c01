The company pulled the server offline Tuesday within an hour of TechCrunch alerting the company, after the data was found by security researcher Oliver Hough. The database itself, running on a hosted Amazon Elasticsearch server, was storing tens of gigabytes of data, including customer names, contact information and case work for each corporate customer. A portion of the database was dedicated to all of the company's corporate clients, allowing its customers to interact with Rubrik staff with issues or complaints. The client database disclosed what appears to be the company's entire roster of corporate customers, including Deloitte, Shell, Amalgamated Bank, the U.K. National Health Service and Homeland Security and other federal government departments. "While building a new solution for customer support, a sandbox environment containing a subset of our customer corporate contact information and support interaction data was potentially accessible for a brief period of time," said a spokesperson for Rubrik. Rubrik didn't say if it would notify its customers or state regulators, per data breach notification laws. Rubrik's data exposure came just months after data management and backup rival Veeam exposed millions of email addresses in its own data exposure.
