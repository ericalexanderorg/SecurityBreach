A Chinese smart home solutions provider has been leaking billions of logs from devices managed via the company's cloud platform, exposing a range of sensitive information about their users. A maker of around 100 smart home or smart automation products, Orvibo claims to have a million customers, both individual users and businesses. The user logs - no fewer than two billion of them, in fact - contain a collection of truly varied and very specific data. There are user IDs, family names and IDs, email addresses, hashed passwords, smart device details, precise location data, IP addresses, as well as account reset codes, which could be used to lock people out of their accounts. Scheduling information for things such as smart lights is also there for anyone to see. In one case, a smart camera log contained "a message that was recorded word for word", according to the analysis, complete with a host of screenshots showing redacted examples of the leaked data.
