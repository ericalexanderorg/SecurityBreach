VpnMentor's research team, led by Noam Rotem, recently uncovered a breached database leaking a massive amount of sensitive financial documents online. Whatever the intended purpose of this database was, over 500,000 highly sensitive and private legal and financial documents were exposed, compromising numerous parties to the risk of fraud and theft. The database appears to be linked to MCA Wizard, an iOS and Android app developed by two companies: Advantage Capital Funding and Argus Capital Funding. Any description of MCA Wizard online includes the following: "Advantage and Argus Capital Funding work as a single united team with market-leading firms around the world and give our clients the highest quality advice possible." Aside from seemingly developing the MCA Wizard app, Advantage and Argus provide funding and startup capital to business owners without access to traditional lending and financial services. Within was a wide range of documents covering many aspects of Advantage and Argus's businesses, finances, and dealings with other companies. If you're a customer of Advantage and Argus and concerned about how this breach might impact you, contact the companies directly to find out what steps they're taking.
