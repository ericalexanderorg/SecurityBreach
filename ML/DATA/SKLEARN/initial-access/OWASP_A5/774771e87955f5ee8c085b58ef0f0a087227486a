US radio giant Entercom reported a data breach that took place in August 2019 after an unauthorized party was able to access database backup files stored third-party cloud hosting services and containing Radio.com user credentials. Data breach exposes Radio.com users' credentials. Entercom says in a notice of data breach sent to affected customers and filed with California's Office of the Attorney General that the data breach was detected while investigating a cyberattack that took place in September 2019. During the investigation conducted with the help of third-party data privacy and computer forensics specialists, Entercom discovered that the attacker was able to gain access to the names, usernames, and passwords of the impacted Radio.com users. Following the data breach, the radio giant implemented several measures designed to prevent similar incidents in the future, including but not limited to passwords rotations, cloud services multifactor authentication and stronger password policies, and staff data security training. Entercom also urges users who received the data breach notification letters to change their passwords for Radio.com accounts and for any other accounts where the same password was used. Just before Christmas eve, in December 2019, Entercom suffered a second cyberattack that led to Internet connectivity problems disabling email communication, access to files, and content to the radio network digital platforms.
