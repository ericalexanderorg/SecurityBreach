Bengaluru: Online education startup Edureka has suffered a significant data leak that exposed sensitive personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers of at least 2 million users, said a team of security experts from SafetyDetectives on Wednesday. The Bengaluru-based startup allegedly left a server exposed without any password protection putting personal data of its users at risk. This meant that mere knowledge of the server's IP address provided unfettered access to a part of the company's database containing user names, email addresses, phone numbers, login activity records, on Amazon servers hosted in the US. SafetyDetectives' security research team led by Anurag Sen found more than 45 million breached records totaling to more than 25 gigabytes including email addresses, full names, and phone numbers, although some of these records could be duplicate records. After failing to receive a response, the SafetyDetectives team then reached out to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team on 13 August and the exposed Edureka server and data were secured soon after. A spokesperson from Edureka confirmed the data breach on its servers but denied that sensitive personal information of its users was exposed due to to this. On 25 August, SafetyDetectives reported that sensitive data including names, credit and debit card details belonging to 700,000 RailYatri users were breached due to similar server vulnerability. In August last year CashKaro, a cashback platform was found to have left its server exposed, leading to a data breach of around 3.5 million users.
