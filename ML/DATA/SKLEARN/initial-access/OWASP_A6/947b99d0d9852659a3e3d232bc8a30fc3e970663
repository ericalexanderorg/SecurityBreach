Yahoo has had a years-long history of both data breaches and cases where hackers break into systems but do not take anything. According to the website for the Yahoo data breach settlement, the company's cyber security issues contained in this matter extended from 2012 to 2016. There, you can find the data breach notices that Yahoo sent to its users in September 2016, December 2016 and October 2017. Verizon Communications Inc., of which Yahoo is now a part, also promised to spend $306 million between 2019 and 2022 to improve Yahoo's cyber security, which is five times more than what Yahoo itself spent between 2013 and 2016. The Yahoo data breach was, in part, as bad as it was because of poor security practices. Some confidential data - including security questions and answers - was stored unencrypted by Yahoo. In April 2019, Yahoo agreed to a $117.5 million settlement associated with the above incidents, which affected about 3 billion people.
