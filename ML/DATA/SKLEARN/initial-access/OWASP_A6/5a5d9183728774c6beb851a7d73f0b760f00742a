New York regulators are investigating a weakness that exposed 885 million mortgage records at First American Financial Corp. [NYSE:FAF] as the first test of the state's strict new cybersecurity regulation. On May 24, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that First American had just fixed a weakness in its Web site that exposed approximately 885 million documents - many of them with Social Security and bank account numbers - going back at least 16 years. On May 29, The New York Times reported that the inquiry by New York's Department of Financial Services is likely to be followed by other investigations from regulators and law enforcement. First American says it has hired a third-party security firm to investigate, and that it shut down external access to the records. The Times says few people outside the real estate industry are familiar with First American, but millions have entrusted their data to the company when they go to close the deal on buying or selling a new home. "First American provides title insurance and settlement services for property sales, which typically require buyers to hand over extensive financial records to other parties in their transactions," wrote Stacy Cowley. News also emerged this week that First American is now the target of a class action lawsuit alleging the Fortune 500 mortgage industry giant "Failed to implement even rudimentary security measures."
