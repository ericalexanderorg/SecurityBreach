Hackers accessed the internal network of Czech cybersecurity company Avast, likely aiming for a supply chain attack targeting CCleaner. Following an investigation, the antivirus maker determined that the attacker was able to gain access using compromised credentials via a temporary VPN account. From the information collected this far, the attack appears to be "An extremely sophisticated attempt," says Jaya Baloo, Avast Chief Information Security Officer. The intruder connected from a public IP address in the U.K. and took advantage of a temporary VPN profile that should no longer have been active and was not protected with two-factor authentication. Suspecting CCleaner as the targeted asset, Avast on September 25 stopped the upcoming updates for the software and started to check prior releases for malicious modification. The old certificate was revoked, says in a statement today Jaya Baloo, Avast Chief Information Security Officer. The company tracked the intruder by keeping the VPN profile active and monitoring the access going through it until mitigation actions could be deployed.
