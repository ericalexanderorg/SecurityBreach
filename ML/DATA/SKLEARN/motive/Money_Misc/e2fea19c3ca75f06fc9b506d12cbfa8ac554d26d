Abouammo, a gregarious and charismatic operator, joined Twitter just days before the platform's initial public offering. "All evil begins with a verification request," one of Abouammo's former colleagues at Twitter joked. After the initial exchange, a representative from a US Saudi Arabian business council in Virginia asked Abouammo to set up a tour at Twitter headquarters. "Nobody told us that we would be approached, that we would be - I don't know if 'seduced' is the right word - that we would be intimidated into giving any kind of Twitter information." Twitter has not responded to questions regarding this issue. In February 2015, a few months after accepting the watch, he made an introduction, putting his handlers in contact with Alzabarah, a Saudi citizen living in San Bruno and a Twitter SRE. Unlike Abouammo, Alzabarah blended into the background at Twitter. On Feb.17, 2016, Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident with a popular YouTube channel and Twitter page who applied for asylum in Canada in 2014 and received it, got an email. Although the alleged spying put Abdulaziz at risk, the deeper damage was done to those Twitter users in Saudi Arabia, he said.
