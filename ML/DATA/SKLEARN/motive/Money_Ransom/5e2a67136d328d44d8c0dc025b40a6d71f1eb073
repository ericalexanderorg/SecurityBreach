A ransomware attack reportedly has affected email, payroll and record-keeping systems at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport this week and also darkened the transportation facility's information screens. According to a report from local news outlet WKYC, the attackers may have also accessed airport employee payroll records containing personal information. An April 22 press release issued by the city of Cleveland acknowledged "Technical issues impacting a small number of systems," including email and airport departure, arrival and baggage information screens. "All other systems are functioning as normal and there are no impacts to flights or safety and security operations," the release continued. The attack began on Monday the 22nd and continued to impact airport display screens as of at least Wednesday, April 24. Cleveland Hopkins International is the 43rd busiest airport in the U.S. and is the main airport serving Cleveland and Northeast Ohio. Last year over 1.327 million passengers passed through the airport.
