The attacker appears to have been active for 14 minutes, dropping tools, such as Mimikatz and Lazagne, and then ultimately, launching Dever Ransomware, which included SMB scanning, persistence mechanisms and lateral movement. WTH? After finding this information, our hypothesis was that this machine was compromised and the Dever ransomware was run from this machine but-how were multiple machines hit? We will touch on this question later in the in the timeline section. This also makes us continue to think, was this manual or automated? Did the ransomware do that automagically? The ransomware IDs were the same for both machines, which usually means the ransomware was executed once and hit multiple machines. 16:31 - Defender turned back on and quarantined the ransomware on Utility Workstation. Dever comes from the Phobos ransomware family, which is based on Dharma AKA CrySis. The biggest time sink about any ransomware scenario, is the time it takes to rebuild or restore the environment. In all, this Dever Ransomware Experience took ~20 hours to do live IR, timeline and write-up.
