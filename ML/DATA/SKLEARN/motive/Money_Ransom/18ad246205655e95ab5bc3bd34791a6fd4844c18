Shipping services company Pitney Bowes was hit with a ransomware attack that disrupted customer access to key services, the company said Monday. The attack comes on the heels of an FBI advisory on Oct. 2 that U.S. companies should be on alert for ransomware attacks, which are increasing in sophistication. A malware attack encrypted information on some systems but did not seem to access any customer or employee data, the company said in a statement on its website. A number of other services were offline or unavailable due to the attack, including SendPro Online in the United Kingdom and Canada, according to Pitney Bowes. The company asked for those customers' patience as it worked to restore services to normal after the attack. In addition to large organizations, Pitney Bowes also counts users of do-it-yourself e-commerce sites like Etsy and Shopify among its customers. Ransomware attacks-in which attackers hijack targets' systems until they pay a ransom, often in Bitcoin-are some of the earliest tools of hackers, yet they remain relevant because they mean easy money for cybercriminals.
