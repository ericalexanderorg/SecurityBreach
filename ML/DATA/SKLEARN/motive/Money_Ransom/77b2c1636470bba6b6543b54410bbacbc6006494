A ransomware attack against conditioned warehousing and transportation provider Bakker Logistiek has caused a cheese shortage in Dutch supermarkets. Bakker Logistiek is one of the largest logistics services providers in the Netherlands, offering air-conditioned warehousing and food transportation for Dutch supermarkets. Last week, Bakker Logistiek suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted devices on their network and disrupted food transportation and fulfillment operations. Bakker Logistiek has said that they could restore affected systems from backups and have begun coordinating with customers to begin deliveries again. It is unknown what ransomware gang targeted Bakker Logistiek, but Verhoeven has told NOS that they speculate that the threat actors gained access to their systems through the recently reported Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon vulnerabilities. Bakker Logistiek is not the first conditioned warehouse operator to get hit in a ransomware attack. In November, global temperature-controlled warehouses operator Americold suffered a ransomware attack that impacted phone systems, email, inventory management, and order fulfillment.
