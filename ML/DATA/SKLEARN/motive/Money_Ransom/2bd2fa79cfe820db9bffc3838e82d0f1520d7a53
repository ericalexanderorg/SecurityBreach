This is a post about how hard disclosure remains and how Surebet247's behaviour now has them experiencing the full blown Streisand effect. I've written before about how I verify breaches and it didn't take long to be pretty confident that per the subject line of the email above, Surebet247 had suffered a data breach. Now many days in and having exhausted all reasonable avenues to drive Surebet247 towards appropriate handling of the incident, Tefo wrote about how Nigeria's SureBet247 has suffered a potential security breach. Once again, keep in mind that as yet, Surebet247 had yet to reply to a single message I'd sent them and did not have the data I'd received, certainly not directly from me and I've seen no evidence to date they'd received it from anyone else either. Oh, now it's interesting! Once you start dealing with the personal information of EU data subjects it invokes the whole GDPR discussion, a fact that Tefo quickly jumped on and used as material for a third article about how Surebet247 is in violation of the European Union's GDPR. I also asked another question in the original email I haven't touched on yet: "Approximately when did you register"? In Stefan's initial response, he advised that "The first newsletter I found is from 13 feb 2014". Co/J7VflCF7CU.- NITDA Nigeria January 7, 2020 SureBet247 suffers data breach and leaks customers' gambling information https://t. Per my earlier tweet about data breach grief, the outcome of this process is a foregone conclusion and assuming I haven't made a massive series of errors in the workings explained above, Surebet247 will ultimately come clean about the breach and take responsibility for their actions.
