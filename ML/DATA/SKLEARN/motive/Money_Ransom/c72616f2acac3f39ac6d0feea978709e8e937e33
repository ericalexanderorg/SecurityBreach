Biomedical and clinical research company Miltenyi Biotec says that it has fully restored systems after a malware attack that took place last month and affected the firm's global IT infrastructure. Miltenyi Biotec's 2,500 employees from 28 countries are developing cell research and therapy products for clinicians and researchers who are working on covid-19 vaccines and treatments. "During the last two weeks, there have been isolated cases where order processing was impaired by malware in parts of our global IT infrastructure," Miltenyi Biotec said in an official statement. Miltenyi Biotec added that customers should expect order delays caused by the temporary operational issues affecting systems during the last two weeks. Even though Miltenyi Biotec has not disclosed the nature of the malware that caused the operational downtime during the last two weeks, the Mount Locker ransomware gang has claimed the attack earlier this month. The ransomware actors have leaked 5% out of the 150 GB of data they claim to have stolen from the company's network on their data leak site on November 4, 2020, in the form of a ZIP archive containing just over 1 GB of Miltenyi Biotec documents. BleepingComputer reached out to a Miltenyi Biotec spokesperson for additional details but did not hear back at the time of publication.
