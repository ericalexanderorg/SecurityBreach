Per a notice put out on the company's investor-facing site, Capcom first noticed the attack early Monday morning when access to certain internal networks were suddenly disrupted. "Capcom expressed its deepest regret for any inconvenience this may cause to its various stakeholders", Capcom wrote. Capcom has said the company is consulting with the police on the investigation, and is taking measures to restore systems. Capcom issued a statement on Thursday saying it was the victim of a cyber-attack by a third party. If Capcom gets infected with Egregor ransomware, they'll likely be directed to a darknet website run by hackers, demanding cryptocurrency payment for the decryption key and a promise not to publicly leak the stolen data. Capcom is the newest studio to be hit by hackers, after Ubisoft and Crytek, who targeted in October. "HELLO CAPCOM! If you are reading this message, it means your network was PENETRATED and all of your files and data has been ENCRYPTED", says the note from the Ragnar Locker ransomware group.
