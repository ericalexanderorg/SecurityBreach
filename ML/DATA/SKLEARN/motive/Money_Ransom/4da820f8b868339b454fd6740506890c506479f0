News Ransomware attack causes long line-ups at food banks in remote northern communities in Nunavut. A cyber attack on the Government of Nunavut could leave thousands of low-income residents in northern communities relying on emergency food vouchers for months. "The recent surge in the number of emergency food aid request has crippled the Igloolik Food Bank," reads a statement published November 12 on the food bank's website. The statement indicated that "The food bank team provided 108 grocery bags of emergency food to 108 homes." "As word got out that the Food Bank team was on site, a long line began to form of people hoping to receive emergency food." The Igloolik Food Bank did not respond to multiple requests for comment from PressProgress. Yvonne Niego, Deputy Minister of Family Services in Nunavut, told PressProgress that remote northern communities like Igloolik are at greater risk to cyber security threats due to the Internet infrastructure in Nunavut.
