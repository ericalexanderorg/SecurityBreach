Louisana's state government has responded to a suspected ransomware attack by shutting down many of its websites and email systems. Every agency in the state has been affected by the shutdown following the attack which follows a spate of other ransomware onslaughts targeting small US towns and cities in recent months. "LA State Police and several federal agencies are investigating this attempted ransomware attack." Not much is known about the type of ransomware attack that has crippled computer systems across the US this year other than the small information that has been leaked from each report. Following the simultaneous attack on 22 Texas municipalities, we know that the ransomware attack exploited the island hopping method of infiltration, thanks to confirmation from the mayor Keene Gary Heinrich. The ransomware attack on the city of Baltimore was reportedly caused by the Robin Hood strain but it's not clear if the same strain has been the culprit of the other attacks. The number of US public sector ransomware attacks doubled in 2019 and the invitation for private-public sector collaboration was described as an unprecedented admission from the FBI that it needs private sector assistance to augment investigatory powers.
