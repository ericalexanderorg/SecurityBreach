University Hospital New Jersey in Newark, New Jersey, paid a $670,000 ransomware demand this month to prevent the publishing of 240 GB of stolen data, including patient info. The attack on the hospital occurred in early September by a ransomware operation known as SunCrypt, who infiltrates a network, steals unencrypted files, and then encrypts all of the data. After a sample of the hospital's private stolen data was published on SunCrypt's data leak site, the hospital contacted the threat actors via their Tor payment site, where they were told that the ransom was $1.7 million. "We want to prevent any further leakage of our data and that is why we are here talking with you," UHNJ told the ransomware operator. The bitcoin blockchain shows that 61.9 bitcoins were sent to the ransomware operation's bitcoin address on September 19th. After negotiations were completed, the ransomware operator told UHNJ, "You did a great job too. Our management owes us." As part of the negotiations, the ransomware operators agreed to provide a decryptor, all stolen data, a security report, and an agreement not to disclose any stolen data or attack UHNJ again. Data breach journalist 'Dissent Doe' of Databreaches.net recently reported that they contacted SunCrypt after noticing UHNJ's data was removed from the ransomware data leak site.
