The City of Saint John has confirmed that the recent cyber attack against it was ransomware. "We do not want to publicly provide details that could further compromise the city's position, including information on the effectiveness of the attack, the systems affected and the success of our containment efforts." On top of the $75,000 ransom - and the cost to get back online after the attack - the city spent a lot of money beefing up its online security. Through the ensuing investigation, Mathieson said the city learned that the hackers had malware planted in the system for six months before they made a move. The city has not been told who was behind the attack because it's part of a continuing investigation. The question facing cities and organizations hit by ransomware attacks is whether to pay the ransom. David Shipley, the CEO of Beauceron Security, a New Brunswick-based cybersecurity firm, said some cities and organizations are choosing to pay the ransom, while others refuse.
