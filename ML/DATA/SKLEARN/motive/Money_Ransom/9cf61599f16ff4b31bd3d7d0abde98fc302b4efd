Wearable device maker Garmin shut down some of its connected services and call centers on Thursday following what the company called a worldwide outage, now confirmed to be caused by a WastedLocker ransomware attack. While Garmin didn't mention it in their outage alert, multiple flyGarmin services used by aircraft pilots are also down, including the flyGarmin website and mobile app, Connext Services and Garmin Pilot Apps. Four hours later, Garmin's main Twitter and Facebook accounts shared the same outage message about the incident impacting Garmin Connect services, including the mobile app and the website, with the company's call centers also being down due to the outage. A source close to the Garmin incident response with first-hand information has confirmed to BleepingComputer that Garmin was attacked by the WastedLocker ransomware. Multiple unconfirmed reports mentioned a ransomware attack that successfully locked some of the company's systems, forcing Garmin to take down parts of the Garmin.com website and the Garmin Connect data sync service. iThome also published a report on a Garmin internal memo earlier about a 'virus' attack affecting the company's internal IT servers and databases that caused Garmin Taiwan factories to shut down production lines for two days. Evil Corp operators were also the ones who used WastedLocker ransomware to encrypt systems on Garmin's network which has led to a major worldwide outage of multiple services and products including Garmin Connect, Garmin Explore, Garmin inReach, and flyGarmin.
