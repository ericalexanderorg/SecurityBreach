The operators behind Sodinokibi Ransomware published download links to files containing what they claim is financial and work documents, as well as customers' personal data stolen from giant U.S. fashion house Kenneth Cole Productions. Sodinokibi is a Ransomware-as-a-Service operation where the operators manage development of the ransomware and the payment portal used by victims to pay the ransoms, while third-party 'affiliates' are in the business of distributing the ransomware to the targets' systems. The ransomware operators claim to have possession of a huge archive of over 70,000 documents with financial and work data, and more than 60,000 records with Kenneth Cole customers' personal information according to the Sodinokibi actors as a researcher at Under the Breach discovered. At the time the ransomware operators also threatened to sell the data they stole from Artech on several data exchange platforms known as heavily frequented by cybercriminals. While we were told that the leaked data appears to be legitimate, Kenneth Cole has not responded to our queries to confirm if and when they were attacked, and whether the data belongs to them. Collecting and stealing sensitive data before encrypting systems with ransomware and then leaking the stolen data in stages until the victims give in and pay the ransom is a recently adopted tactic by ransomware gangs. Just to get an idea of the scale of the ransoms asked by ransomware gangs during the last six years, the FBI said earlier this week at the RSA security conference that victims have paid more than $140 million worth of bitcoins to ransomware operators based on analysis of collected ransom notes and ransomware bitcoin wallets.
