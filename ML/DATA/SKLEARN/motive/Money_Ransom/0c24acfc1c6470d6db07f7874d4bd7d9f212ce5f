Officials with the Baltimore County Public Schools are investigating a ransomware attack that distributed virtual learning for students on Wednesday. Baltimore County Public Schools can now confirm we were the victim of a Ransomeware cyber attack. The Baltimore County Public Schools district is one of the largest in the U.S. and serves about 115,000 students across dozens of schools. Although the district's schools remain shut because of the Thanksgiving break and are not physically functional due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in a separate alert, the Baltimore Public Schools noted that its virtual learning classes would be called off until Monday, the Baltimore Sun reported. City Schools is aware of computer network challenges today in Baltimore County schools. The attacks against Baltimore County school district are the latest in a series of ransomware incidents targeting schools and universities in the U.S. Cybersecurity experts had been predicting a spike in ransomware attacks as new hybrid learning environments go online and unpatched equipment that has spent months in the homes of students and faculty is reconnected to school networks. In September, Hartford Public Schools in Connecticut cancelled its classes as a result of a ransomware attack.
