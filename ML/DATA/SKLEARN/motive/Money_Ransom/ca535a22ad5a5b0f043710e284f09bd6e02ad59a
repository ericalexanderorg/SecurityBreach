A widely-used ASP.NET service provider, used by more than 440,000 customers, was taken offline on Saturday after cyber criminals targeted its systems with ransomware. The SmarterASP website, too, was taken offline on Saturday before it was restored the next day. SmarterASP subsequently said this morning that it had developed a solution to resolving the problem, but needs more time to fully restore services. Work is underway on a "New system" built to prevent issues recurring in the future. No additional detail as to the nature of the new system, or how it would be different from SmarterASP's previous system, was released. At the time of writing, the company has restored 40% of its customers' affected accounts, according to its Facebook page, and expects most services to be restored over the next 24 hours. The company hasn't disclosed whether it's restoring its services from an archival or backup system, or whether it's complied with the cyber criminals' ransom demands.
