The University of Northampton has been hit by a cyber attack that resulted in the disruption of its IT and telephone systems and servers. The university told IT Pro the attack was detected on March 17, that it has notified the ICO and, as a precaution, is liaising with the police to investigate the attack further. The university highlighted that cyber attacks on its institutions are becoming increasingly common "As criminals target educational establishments with no regard to the disruption to teaching and learning such attacks cause." "At the University of Northampton, we take the safety and security of our information as well as the continuity of our systems and services extremely seriously - and will continue to take every action to protect the organisation against cyber attacks," the spokesperson added. The NCSC said that since late February 2021, there has been an increased number of ransomware attacks on education establishments in the UK, including schools, colleges and universities. At the start of September last year, Northumbria University suffered a cyber attack that forced the clearing hotline and student portal offline. Similarly the week after, Newcastle University was held ransom after cyber criminals hacked into its systems at the start of September.
