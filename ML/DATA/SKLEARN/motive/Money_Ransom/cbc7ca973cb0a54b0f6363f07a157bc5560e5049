The operators behind the Maze Ransomware have claimed responsibility for the cyberattack affecting the City of Pensacola, Florida, but state that they are not affiliated with the recent shooting at NAS Pensacola. In an email conversation with BleepingComputer, the operators of the Maze Ransomware stated that they were responsible for encrypting the city's data and have demanded a $1,000,000 ransom for a decryptor. Maze is not the first ransomware to make these claims, but as we have seen with the release of Allied Universal's documents, the Maze crew appears to be willing to follow up with their threats. Maze has shared documents that were allegedly stolen from the city, but did not state if they have given a deadline to Pensacola or will release them. Without our prompting, the Maze Ransomware operators expressed concerns about being linked to the recent NAS Pensacola shooting and told BleepingComputer that they had nothing to do with it. Maze also wanted to reassure us that they purposely avoided emergency services, or what they call 'socially significant services', such as 911. When we attempted to confirm if the information provided by Maze is accurate, Kaycee Lagarde, Public Information Officer for the City of Pensacola, told BleepingComputer that due to ongoing investigations they could not provide additional details.
