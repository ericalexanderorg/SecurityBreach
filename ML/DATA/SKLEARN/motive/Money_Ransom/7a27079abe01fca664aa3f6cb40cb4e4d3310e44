Flagship battling to restore services after cyber attack #UKHousing. A large housing association in East Anglia is still battling to restore all its services more than a fortnight after being hit by a major cyber attack #UKHousing. An investigation into the attack is ongoing, but cybersecurity specialists have informed Flagship that it involved the Sodinokibi ransomware - the same malware used by cyber criminals to demand Â£4.6m from foreign exchange company Travelex, following an infection on New Year's Eve. The landlord said it has not engaged with those responsible and so is "Not aware" of the ransom demand. "Matt Brazier, director of IT and systems at Flagship, said:"The investigation is still ongoing, and we continue to work with the Information Commissioner's Office and our cybersecurity specialists. "However, we have managed to safely bring back most of our essential systems and our teams continue to work around the clock to bring the rest back." "We have sent a letter to all our customers to notify them of the incident. And as an extra security measure and for peace of mind, we have offered fraud and web monitoring services to both staff and customers."
