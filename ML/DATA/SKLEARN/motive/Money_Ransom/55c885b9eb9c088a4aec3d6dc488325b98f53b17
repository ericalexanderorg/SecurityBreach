PITTSBURG, Calif. - The Pittsburg Unified School District is now the latest victim of a ransomware attack in Contra Costa County. The attack is affecting every school, office and most services in the school district. School district Superintendent Janet Schulze announced it on Facebook. The district isn't saying how much money the hackers are asking for. Last Friday ransomware attackers struck the Contra Costa County library system, affecting all 26 branches. The sheriff's department and district attorney cybercrime units are investigating. It's unclear if the library and school district attacks are connected.
