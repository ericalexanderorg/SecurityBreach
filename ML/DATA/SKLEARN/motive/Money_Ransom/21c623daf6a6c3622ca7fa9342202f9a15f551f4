Another public administration in the U.S. surrenders cybercriminal demands as La Porte County, Indiana, pays $130,000 to recover data on computer systems impacted by ransomware. Three days later, the government emails and the county website were still not working, The News Dispatch reported. "Fortunately, our county liability agent of record, John Jones, last year recommended a cybersecurity insurance policy which the county commissioners authorized from Travelers Insurance" - Dr. Vidya Kora, La Porte County Board of Commissioners President, told The News Dispatch. According to WSBT, the county had backup servers but the malware infected them. The news publication says that the ransomware affecting La Porte County's systems is Ryuk, the same one that attacked the City of Lake City on June 10 in what the municipality called a "Triple threat" because it came from an Emotet infection that delivered Trickbot trojan, which then deployed Ryuk. La Porte County is not the only administration to pay for getting their files back. Mayors in the US adopted a resolution not to pay cybercriminals after ransomware infections, in order to discourage them.
