In a country that claims to be at the forefront of digitization and data security, the criminals managed to access the database of thousands of customers of the company Vastaamo after detecting vulnerabilities in their system. Extortionists demanded around 450,000 euros in exchange for not publishing the clinical and mental health data of thousands of people. The criminals started to publish the data of 100 people every day in the encrypted web Tor two days ago. As the company was resisting to attend the demands of the hackers, personal data of over 200 people - including minors - have been released online. "An unknown hostile party has been in contact with Vastaamo and claims to have obtained confidential information from the company's customers. The Central Criminal Police launched a criminal investigation into the matter. Immediate notifications were also made to the Finnish Cyber ​​Security Center, Valvira and the Data Protection Commissioner. In addition, Vastamo took immediate steps to clarify the matter in cooperation with external and independent security experts," the company said in a press release. The data of another 100 people were published on Thursday night. Ilta Sanomat exchanged several messages with them on Thursday, and according to the tabloid the criminals said they did not know that there was data of minors among the published information.
