GOUVERNEUR, N.Y. - St. Lawrence Health System says computers at Canton-Potsdam, Massena and Gouverneur hospitals were attacked by ransomware early Tuesday morning. Health system officials said the virus has been identified as a new variant of Ryuk ransomware "Previously unknown to antivirus software providers and security agencies" and that it was discovered within hours of the initial attack. The New York State Department of Health confirmed earlier in the day that there had been a cyberattack within the St. Lawrence Health System. "DOH has been in communication with St. Lawrence Hospital System, which operates Canton-Potsdam Hospital and Gouverneur Hospital, about a cyberattack," said DOH Public Information Officer Jeffrey Hammond. "At approximately 4:30 this morning, St. Lawrence Health Systems notified St. Lawrence County Emergency Services Department that they are going to be on complete diversion until further notice," said Matt Denner, director, St. Lawrence County Emergency Services. 7 News reached out to St. Lawrence Health System to clarify information about diversion, but officials did not reply. Hospitals are frequent targets of hackers because their computer records can literally be a matter of life and death, so hospitals can often be blackmailed into paying to have the malware go away.
