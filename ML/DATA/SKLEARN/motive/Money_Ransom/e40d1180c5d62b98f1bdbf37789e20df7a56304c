Officials from Mt. Pleasant city government say no election data was breached during a Saturday ransomware attack. The attack occurred Saturday morning from a remote location targeting the city's computers and phone system, said Nancy Ridley, Mt. Pleasant city manager, in a press release. The city's firewall held, and at this time no personal information is believed compromised. An investigation is underway by the Michigan State Police. While a thorough review of data is taking place, both city hall and the Department of Public Safety are closed for face-to-face meetings and phone service is down. A ransomware attack is one in which data is compromised by malware, and unless money is paid to the attacker, is either published or the owner's access is blocked. In June, a hacker penetrated Mid Michigan College's email system, compromising the accounts up 10 employees and the personal data of potentially 16,000 people.
