Blueprints of government buildings and bank vaults among exposed files. A data breach has leaked thousands of sensitive documents including the blueprints of bank vaults after a cyber-attack against a Swedish security company. Gunnebo, based in Gothenburg, specializes in enhanced security for buildings, such as fire safety measures and security doors. According to local media, data including drawings of bank vaults, monitoring and alarm equipment, and security functions for ATMs was available for download. Other sensitive documents include information from the Riksdag and classified drawings of the Swedish Tax Agency's office in Sundbyberg. The incident was reported to the Swedish Security Police back in August. The company employed IT specialists who shut down the servers to isolate the attack, a press release issued at the time read. It also took steps to improve its security posture. "Security always comes first for Gunnebo and as a direct consequence of the incident, we have therefore decided to shed light on our IT structure, which is a time consuming but important job," said Syr√©n.
