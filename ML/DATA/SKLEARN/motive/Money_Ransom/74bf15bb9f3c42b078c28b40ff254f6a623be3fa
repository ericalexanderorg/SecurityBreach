The cyber attack on Hackney Council is "Morally repugnant", says Hackney mayor Phillip Glanville. More than a week after the attack, which has affected key council services such as payments and applications, some services are still disrupted and may continue to be so for some time, according to the mayor. The attack, which is being probed by the National Cyber Security Centre and the Information Commissioner's Office, began on or around 13 October. Glanville added: "Being clear and transparent is really important to the council and it would like to give more details about the nature of the attack and the impact on services, but it must also make sure that it does not inadvertently assist the attackers by doing so." The attack has hit the council's legacy and non-cloud-based systems, including those for residents to make payments, logging repairs for tenants and approving applications. The attack also affected new applications to join the council's housing waiting list, for housing benefit, or for its council tax reduction scheme, although emergency homelessness advice and support remains available. "The mayor added:"Where all payment systems are unavailable, nobody who is unable to make a payment to us - whether a fixed-penalty notice, rent payment or otherwise - will be financially penalised because of this attack.
