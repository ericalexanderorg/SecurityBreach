Synoptek, a California business that provides cloud hosting and IT management services to more than a thousand customer nationwide, suffered a ransomware attack this week that has disrupted operations for many of its clients, according to sources. Irvine, Calif.-based Synoptek is a managed service provider that maintains a variety of cloud-based services for more than 1,100 customers across a broad spectrum of industries, including state and local governments, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, retail and software. The only official statement about any kind of incident came late Friday evening from the company's Twitter page, which said that on Dec. 23 it experienced a "Credential compromise which has been contained," and that Synoptek "Took immediate action and have been working diligently with customers to remediate the situation." Two sources who work at the company have now confirmed their employer was hit by Sodinokibi, a potent ransomware strain also known as "rEvil" that encrypts data and demands a cryptocurrency payment in return for a digital key that unlocks access to infected systems. One Synoptek customer briefed on the attack who asked to remain anonymous said that once inside Synoptek's systems, the intruders used a remote management tool to install the ransomware on client systems. A Sodinokibi attack earlier this month on Colorado-based IT services firm Complete Technology Solutions resulted in ransomware being installed on computers at more than 100 dentistry practices that relied on the company. The group behind the Maze Ransomware malware strain recently began following through on a similar threat, erecting a site on the public Internet that lists victims by name and includes samples of sensitive documents stolen from victims who have opted not to pay.
