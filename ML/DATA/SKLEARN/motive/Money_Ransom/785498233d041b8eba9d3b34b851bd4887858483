Systems went down across the company's international network, including its U.S. subsidiaries, but much of the damage was in the company's European base. A number of systems connected to the Aebi Schmidt network across the world were left paralyzed. It isn't immediately known what kind of ransomware knocked the company's systems offline. The multinational manufacturing giant recently expanded its U.S. presence with the acquisition of M-B Companies, a maker of snow removal and cleaning machines, following earlier acquisitions of winter maintenance equipment maker Meyer Products and Swenson Products. Aebi Schmidt is the latest company downed by ransomware in recent weeks. Aluminum manufacturing giant Norsk Hydro was forced offline briefly following a ransomware attack in March. It was a better response than drinks company Arizona Beverages, which was hit by ransomware a month later, causing its systems to shutter for a week - despite warnings from the FBI weeks earlier that the company was infected with malware lying dormant.
