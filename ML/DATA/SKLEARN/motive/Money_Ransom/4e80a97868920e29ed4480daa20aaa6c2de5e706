On February 8, 2021, Wolfe Eye Clinic in Iowa suffered a ransomware attack that resulted in widespread encryption of data on its network. An investigation was immediately launched into the attack, but due to the complexity of the attack it took four months to complete the forensic investigation and the full scope of the attack was not determined until May 28, 2021. Wolfe Eye Clinic said the clinic refused to pay the ransom and was recovering encrypted data from backups. Wolfe Eye Clinic operates diagnostic and surgical centers throughout Iowa and serves 40 communities in the state. It is unclear how extensive the attack was and how it affected the ability of the clinic to operate, but Wolfe Eye Clinic has recently confirmed that the forensic investigation revealed the attackers had access to systems that contained the protected health information of approximately 500,000 current and former patients. It is unclear what information, if any, was exfiltrated from Wolfe Eye Clinic systems prior to the deployment of ransomware. Two of the worst attacks were suffered by Netgain Technologies and CaptureRx, both of which affected many healthcare provider clients; however, with 500,000 patients affected, the Wolfe Eye Clinic ranks as one of the worst ransomware attacks on a single healthcare provider.
