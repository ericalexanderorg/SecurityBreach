Temple Har Shalom in Warren, New Jersey had their network breached by the actors behind the Sodinokibi Ransomware who encrypted numerous computers on the network. In an email seen by BleepingComputer, Temple Har Shalom informed their congregation that they discovered the ransomware attack on January 9th after staff had trouble connecting to the Internet. "The encryption affected all of our server-based files and electronic data. We have a mechanical back up for those files and data, but the back-up was encrypted as well. Certain computers were affected in full. Others were unaffected and remain functional," the email from Temple Har Shalom stated. Temple Har Shalom states that they will be contacting congregation members for information needed to recreate encrypted files. Like all ransomware victims, the temple feels violated by the attack but does not think they were targeted as a Jewish organization. As Sodinokibi is known to steal files before encrypting them, they may have gained access to the personal data of congregants. BleepingComputer has contacted both the ransomware actors and the temple, but have not heard back at this time.
