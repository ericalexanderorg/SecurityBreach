Home  News  Major data center provider hit by ransomware attack, claims report. CyrusOne, a major provider of enterprise data center services, is reported to have suffered a ransomware attack. The Dallas-headquartered company, which operates more than 30 data centers across the United States, China, London, and Singapore, is reported by ZDnet to have had some of its systems infected by the REvil ransomware. According to security journalist Catalin Cimpanu, who broke the story, the firm was hit by a targeted attack against its network yesterday, and received a ransom message demanding payment for the recovery of encrypted files. What isn't known at present is how the ransomware managed to breach CyrusOne's systems. It's worth remembering that a recovery from a ransomware attack is not complete until the method through which the security breach occurred has been identified and fixed. The worst thing in the world would be to recover after a ransomware attack only to find yourself hit again by another attack the following week.
