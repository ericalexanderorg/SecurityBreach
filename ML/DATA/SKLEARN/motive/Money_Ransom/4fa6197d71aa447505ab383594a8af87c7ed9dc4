Maze Ransomware operators claim responsibility for another cyber attack, this time against leading wire and cable manufacturer Southwire Company, LLC from Carrollton, Georgia. Southwire is one of North America's leading wire and cable makers, "Building wire and cable, utility products, metal-clad cable, portable and electronic cord products, OEM wire products and engineered products" per a press release published in January 2019. The ransom demanded is 850 BTC, amounting to approximately $6 million. As customary in the case of Maze Ransomware, the ransom note also says that company data has also been exfiltrated, ready to be published if the ransom is not paid. In an email conversation with BleepingComputer, the group refuted rumors of a $9 million ransom that started on Reddit ??????and also sent proof that Southwire data was downloaded from their servers. Maze ransomware's operators have recently claimed a number of other attacks including one against the City of Pensacola, Florida, that came with a $1 million ransom, and another one that impacted security staffing firm Allied Universal that was asked to pay $2.3 million to have their network decrypted. Southwire has been hit by the ransomware attack during early Monday and affected computing on a companywide basis.
