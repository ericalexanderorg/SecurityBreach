A darknet hacker revealed hundreds of images yesterday purporting to be stolen know-your-customer data from leading crypto exchanges. Today, the exchanges have revealed some of the security measures they use in order to explain why the data was not hacked from their systems-but obtained through other means. Despite this evidence, crypto exchanges have offered proof that their systems were not broken into-which suggests the data may have been obtained through phishing attacks or a third party KYC breach. "I don't see any clear evidence that any exchange was hacked," Jesse Powell, CEO at Kraken, told Decrypt, adding, "We have a way of knowing if an image came from our system. I won't say what we do but there is definitely a way to know if it came from us." In a statement, it revealed that every image processed through Binance for KYC purposes is embedded with a hidden digital watermark. After analysing the sample images from the data dump, Binance concluded there was no hack. Despite presenting evidence of what would be a record data haul, the hacker has not been able to conclusively prove the data was obtained from the exchanges.
