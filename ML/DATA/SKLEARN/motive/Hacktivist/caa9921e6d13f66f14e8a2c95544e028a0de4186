A security breach of Proctortrack, the software Western University uses to monitor student exams remotely, is adding new fuel to a debate raging on campus over privacy concerns about the program. On Thursday morning, students at Western's Ivey Business School received an email notifying them of a "Data breach" at Proctortrack. "Our logs show there has been no data breach on the servers," said Siddharth in an interview with CBC News. "Student data has never left Canada. It's still on their servers. We just froze that data. Canadian students don't need to worry." "Western takes the data protection and privacy of its students very seriously and will not be proceeding with the use of Proctortrack until we are confident that it is safe to do so," Western's statement says. The data breach didn't affect him because he'd refused to download the software on his computer due to privacy concerns. Even if student data wasn't taken, the security breach will create headaches for Western in what has already been a topsy-turvy year trying to continue normal operations amid the pandemic.
