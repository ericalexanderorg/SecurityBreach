Exclusive Twilio today confirmed one or more miscreants sneaked into its unsecured cloud storage systems and modified a copy of the JavaScript SDK used by its customers. In short, someone was able to get into Twilio's Amazon Web Services S3 bucket, which was left unprotected and world-writable, and alter the TaskRouter v1.20 SDK to include "Non-malicious" code that appeared designed primarily to track whether or not the modification worked. "We can confirm that the TaskRouter v1.20 SDK contained a non-malicious modification inserted by an external third party due to a misconfigured S3 bucket. We became aware of the incident and immediately worked to close the S3 misconfiguration and audit all S3 buckets." "These measures were implemented within 12 hours to resolve the issue. We have no evidence at this time that any customer data was accessed by a bad actor. Furthermore, at no time did a malicious party have access to Twilio's internal systems, code or data." The JavaScript SDK is Twilio's recommended method for linking your business events, such as incoming phone calls from customers and alerts from monitoring systems, to its TaskRouter platform, which routes calls and jobs to your staff. If someone who prefers to speak Spanish hits the "Call me, I need help" button on your website, your web app uses the TaskRouter SDK to create a task, in this case "Call this customer now," which is routed via a queue to a staffer who can speak Spanish and handle the call. Twilio tells us it is planning to issue a report with more information on the incident in the coming days.
