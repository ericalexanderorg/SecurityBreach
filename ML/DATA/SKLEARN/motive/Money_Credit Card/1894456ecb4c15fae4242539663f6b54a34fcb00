On Tuesday of this week, one of the more popular underground stores peddling credit and debit card data stolen from hacked merchants announced a blockbuster new sale: More than 5.3 million new accounts belonging to cardholders from 35 U.S. states. Multiple sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the card data came from compromised gas pumps, coffee shops and restaurants operated by Hy-Vee, an Iowa-based company that operates a chain of more than 245 supermarkets throughout the Midwestern United States. This type of point-of-sale malware is capable of copying data stored on a credit or debit card's magnetic stripe when those cards are swiped at compromised payment terminals. According to two sources who asked not to be identified for this story - including one at a major U.S. financial institution - the card data stolen from Hy-Vee is now being sold under the code name "Solar Energy," at the infamous Joker's Stash carding bazaar. "We are aware of reports from payment processors and the card networks of payment data being offered for sale and are working with the payment card networks so that they can identify the cards and work with issuing banks to initiate heightened monitoring on accounts," Hy-Vee spokesperson Tina Pothoff said. The card account records sold by Joker's Stash, known as "Dumps," apparently stolen from Hy-Vee are being sold for prices ranging from $17 to $35 apiece. Those individual dumps records - when encoded onto a new magnetic stripe on virtually anything the size of a credit card - can be used to purchase stolen merchandise in big box stores.
