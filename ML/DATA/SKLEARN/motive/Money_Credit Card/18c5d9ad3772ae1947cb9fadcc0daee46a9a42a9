If you have swiped your payment card at the popular Checkers and Rally's drive-through restaurant chains in past 2-3 years, you should immediately request your bank to block your card and notify it if you notice any suspicious transaction. Checkers, one of the largest drive-through restaurant chains in the United States, disclosed a massive long-running data breach yesterday that affected an unknown number of customers at 103 of its Checkers and Rally's locations-nearly 15% of its restaurants. After becoming aware of a "Data security issue involving malware" at some Checkers and Rally's locations, the company launched an extensive investigation which revealed that unknown hackers managed to plant malware on its point-of-sale systems across 103 stores. The company pointed out that the investigation found no evidence suggesting that hackers made off with additional information belonging to the affected cardholders, and that "Not all guests who visited the listed restaurants" are affected by the breach. One restaurant in California had PoS malware installed on its system in December 2015, which continually captured customers payment card information until March 2018. The restaurant chain assured its customers that the company worked closely with the third-party data security experts to contain and remove the malware upon discovering the security incident. The company recommends customers to check their billing statements, order a credit report, and report any suspicious incident to the Federal Trade Commission.
