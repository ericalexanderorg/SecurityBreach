"PFD recently reported on the observed increase of PoS attacks against fuel dispenser merchants, and it is likely these merchants are an increasingly attractive target for cybercrime groups," according to the Visa alert. Researchers attributed the attacks to FIN8, the financially motivated threat group whose typical mode of attack is to steal payment-card data from PoS environments, particularly those of retailers, restaurants and hospitality providers. Visa researchers recovered command-and-control domains previously used by FIN8 in threat activity from the attacks they observed, pointing to their involvement. Attackers then used a RAM scraper to harvest payment-card data from the PoS system. The malware used by attackers targeted data from the magnetic-stripe transactions specifically, while those using chips transactions in-store were left unscathed from the attack. Even before Visa's warning of increased attacks, there has been evidence of the rise of fuel pumps as targets for cybercriminals. In addition to payment-card scrapers used in these recent attacks, researchers also have previously observed the widespread use of Bluetooth-enabled skimmers to steal payment information from fuel pumps, according to a published report.
