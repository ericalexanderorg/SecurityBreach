The online store for the Rooster Teeth video-streaming service has been hit with a malicious web redirect attack by Magecart, which allowed the cybercriminals to harvest users' payment-card details. Rooster Teeth, which offers original podcasts, animated shows and short-form content aimed at Millennials, said that the attack happened on December 2. "The malicious code directed users entering a checkout on the site to a spoofed webpage where they were asked to enter payment-card details in order to complete their purchases," the Rooster Teeth notice explained. The Magecart crooks behind this attack mixed up their tactics for this incident, according to Elad Shapira, head of research at Panorays. "The recent Rooster Teeth data breach illustrates how the Magecart threat continues to evolve while often targeting organizations through their third parties," he said via email. The issue affected the Rooster Teeth online store, where the company offers various kinds of clothing and other merchandise. Rooster Teeth free streaming accounts and its "FIRST" subscription memberships weren't impacted, the company said.
