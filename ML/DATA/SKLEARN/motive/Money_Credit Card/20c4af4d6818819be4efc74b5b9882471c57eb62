In July 2017, Aloba and his co-conspirators compromised the email account of a court employee and used it to send the phishing emails to coworkers. The malicious messages included links to a phishing website set up to request LASC users their email addresses and passwords. "Thousands of court employees received the Dropbox email, and hundreds disclosed their email credentials to the attacker. The compromised email accounts then were used to send the roughly 2 million phishing emails." continues the DoJ. Aloba and his co-conspirators also sent phishing messages pretending to come from American Express, Wells Fargo and other companies. The information provided by the victims through the fake American Express website was sent to an email account under the control of the Texan man.
