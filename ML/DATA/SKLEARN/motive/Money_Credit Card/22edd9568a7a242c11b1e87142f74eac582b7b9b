Portland, Oregon-based children's clothing maker Hanna Andersson has quietly disclosed a breach to affected customers. Very few details of the breach have been made public. According to the breach notification letter, the "Incident potentially involved information submitted during the final purchase process on our website, www.hannaandersson.com, including name, shipping address, billing address, payment card number, CVV code, and expiration date." These details are often known on the dark web as 'fullz'; that is, the data contains all the information necessary for a criminal to make fraudulent purchases via the internet. The Hannah Andersson breach has not been confirmed as a Magecart attack, but such attacks generally involve the insertion of malicious skimmer code into the victim company's payment code. Hanna Andersson is providing no details of the attack. "We can definitively state," says the Verizon 2019 Payment Security Report, "We have never reviewed an environment or investigated a PCI data breach involving an affected entity that was truly PCI DSS compliant." Coincidentally, this report was published at the very end of the Hanna Andersson breach. SecurityWeek has contacted Hanna Andersson for further details.
