Hackers have breached the infrastructure of Volusion, a provider of cloud-hosted online stores, and are delivering malicious code that records and steals payment card details entered by users in online forms. The incident took place this week after hackers gained access to Volusion's Google Cloud infrastructure, where they modified a JavaScript file and included malicious code that logs card details entered in online forms. The incident is what cyber-security experts call a Magecart attack or web card skimming, where crooks steal payment card details from online shops, rather than ATMs. These types of hacks have been happening for years, but they've intensified over the past two. Most Magecart attacks take place when hackers use vulnerabilities in self-hosted stores to plant skimmer code on outdated online shops. Sometimes, hackers also manage to breach cloud-based platforms - like Volusion - or companies that provide widgets, analytics, ads, or other secondary services to online stores. Something like the latter case happened in May when hackers breached the cloud infrastructure for seven companies that provided services to online stores - namely Alpaca Forms, Picreel, AppLixir, RYVIU, OmniKick, eGain, and AdMaxim. The May incidents were traced to those companies' misconfigured cloud-hosting accounts, which allowed hackers to modify existing files without permission.
