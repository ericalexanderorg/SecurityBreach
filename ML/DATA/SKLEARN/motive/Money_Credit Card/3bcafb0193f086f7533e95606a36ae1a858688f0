You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act: The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. You may limit prescreened offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization.
