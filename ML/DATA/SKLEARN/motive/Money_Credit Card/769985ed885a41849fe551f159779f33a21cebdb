Security researchers discovered a new batch of nine websites infected with malicious JavaScript that steals payment card info from online shoppers. More recent activity linked to this actor was documented by researchers Jacob Pimental and Max Kersten towards the end of January when they published details about two sports events ticket resellers running card skimming code. The two researchers noticed that the skimmer is hosted on 'toplevelstatic.com,' which resolves to multiple IP addresses, mostly in Russia. "The used obfuscation is similar to the previous skimmer script, where the first stage functions as a loader, whereas the second stage contains the original script with added garbage code and string obfuscation. Note that the second stage script is only loaded if it is not tampered with, based on the hash check that is included in the second stage" - Max Kersten. The two researchers found nine websites infected by this particular code and tried to contact all owners about the threat. MyMetroGear - skimmer found on February 4 is also present at the moment of writing. The MageCart threat is relentless and as long as there are vulnerable websites, hackers will try to plant a payment card skimmer on it.
