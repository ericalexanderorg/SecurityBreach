Forever 21 said Thursday it is tightening security efforts at its store cash wraps following its disclosure last month of a breach at some of its U.S. stores. Details of the security breach, which was first disclosed publicly by the company in November, did not include how many stores within the U.S. were impacted or in what states. Forever 21 does business in 57 countries via a fleet of more than 815 stores. Forever 21 confirmed the malware was able to access cardholder names in some instances but in most cases was only able to obtain card numbers, expirations and verification codes. The vulnerability in the system occurred between April 3 and Nov. 18 of this year with each store impacted by the breach subject to varying lengths of exposure ranging from days to the entire April-November period, Forever 21 said. The company's investigation also found some stores' authorized payment data logs could have also potentially been under attack by the malware. "In addition to addressing encryption, Forever 21 is continuing to work with security firms to enhance its security measures," the company said in a statement Thursday.
