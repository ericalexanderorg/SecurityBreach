The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a post buried on its website that the hackers obtained "Inappropriate access" to a number of broker and agent accounts, which "Engaged in excessive searching" of the government's healthcare marketplace systems. In a letter sent to affected customers this week, CMS disclosed that sensitive personal data - including partial Social Security numbers, immigration status and some tax information - may have been taken. Other information provided on the application, including expected income, tax filing status, family relationships, whether the applicant is a citizen or an immigrant, immigration document types and numbers, employer name, whether the applicant was pregnant, and whether the applicant already had health insurance;. Information provided by other federal agencies and data sources to confirm the information provided on the application, and whether the Marketplace asked the applicant for documents or explanations;. The government said that no bank account information - including credit card numbers, or diagnostic and treatment information - was taken. "Not only can the attacker steal the identity of anyone in the breach, but they can also use this information to appear credible when crafting mobile spear-phishing messages against their targets." "This is especially true if the data that was leaked is accurate, as health information, family relationships and insurance information can make it extremely easy for an attacker to steal the identity of anyone affected by the breach," he said.
