June 18, 2019 - Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, the parent company of the American Medical Collection Agency, filed for Chapter 11 protection after an eight-month long system hack breached the personal, financial, and health data of up to 20 million Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, and BioReference patients, according to Bloomberg. Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau CEO Russell Fuchs wrote in the court filing that the company has incurred "Enormous expenses that were beyond the ability of the debtor to bear." The company has spent $3.8 million to mail over 7 million individual notices to individual breach victims. In March, AMCA discovered the hack, and the investigation revealed the breach occurred from August 1, 2018 to March 30, 2019-when it was discovered. According to Quest's 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the AMCA hack breached the data of up to 11.9 million patients and included credit card numbers, bank account details, medical data, and other personal data like Social Security numbers. With BioReference's numbers, the tally of the AMCA breach reached more than 20 million patients, which prompted the Michigan Attorney General to launch an investigation. The bankruptcy filing may answer those senators questions by revealing how AMCA finally detected the breach: The company began receiving notices that a high number of credit cards tied to its web portal were connected to an abundance of fraudulent charges. The bankruptcy filing also revealed that LabCorp, Quest, and two of its other largest clients, Conduent and CareCentrix stopped doing business with AMCA due to the breach, which fueled the bankruptcy petition.
