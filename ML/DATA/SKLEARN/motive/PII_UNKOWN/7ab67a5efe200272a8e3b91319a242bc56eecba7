Miscreants gained access to US healthcare billing vendor AccuDoc Solutions' database for about a week in September, exposing the data of at least 2.65 million people. North Carolina-based Atrium Health, a customer of AccuDoc Solutions, this week said it had been affected by the breach. Atrium Health - which repeatedly emphasised its innocence - said AccuDoc had terminated unauthorised access as soon as the breach was identified, closed off the compromised path and rebuilt the affected database. In about 700,000 cases, it also included social security numbers, Atrium Health said - these people will be offered free identity monitoring services. AccuDoc provides billing services - such as preparing paper statements and operating a website for patients to pay for services - to various healthcare providers. The Charlotte Observer reported that Perkins had said "Anything is possible" when asked whether the breach might have affected more people. The Register has contacted AccuDoc for confirmation that the breach affected just these two customers.
