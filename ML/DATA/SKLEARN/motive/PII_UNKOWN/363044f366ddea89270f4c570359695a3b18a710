Three U.S. universities have disclosed data breach incidents impacting personally identifiable information of students or employees following unauthorized access to some of their employees' email accounts. All three universities - Graceland University, Oregon State University, and Missouri Southern State University - have notified the individuals whose personal information was potentially stolen or accessed about the security incidents. No evidence has been found of the impacted personal information being stolen or used in a malicious manner while investigating the disclosed data privacy incidents involving all three universities. Graceland University says in a notice of data breach published on June 14 that an "Unauthorized user gained access to the email accounts of current employees," on March 29, 2019, as well as "From April 1-30 and April 12-May 1, 2019, respectively." As the university discovered during the breach investigation, "The personal information of some people who had interacted with these email accounts over the past several years was available during the time the unauthorized user(s) had access." Oregon State University states in a press release that "636 student records and family records of students containing personally identifiable information were potentially affected by a data privacy incident that occurred in early May.". Missouri Southern State University, the third entity which reported a breach, states in a notice of data breach sent to the Office of the Vermont Attorney General that it was alerted of a possible cyber attack triggered by a phishing email on January 9.
