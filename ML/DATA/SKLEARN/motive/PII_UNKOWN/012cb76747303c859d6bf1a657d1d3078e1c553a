As detailed in the SEC notification from Quest Diagnostics, AMCA informed the company that "Between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019 an unauthorized user had access to AMCA's system that contained information that AMCA had received from various entities, including Quest Diagnostics, and information that AMCA collected itself." Suspended sending collection requests to AMCA; provided notifications to affected health plans and will ensure that notification is provided to regulators and others as required by federal and state law; and been working and will continue to work diligently, along with Optum360, AMCA and outside security experts, to investigate the AMCA data security incident and its potential impact on Quest Diagnostics and its patients. "As of May 31, 2019, AMCA believes that the number of Quest Diagnostics patients whose information was contained on AMCA's affected system was approximately 11.9 million people," also says the SEC notification. Quest Diagnostics sent BleepingComputer an official statement saying that the unauthorized user was able to access information provided to AMCA by various entities and that Quest is "Working with forensic experts to investigate the matter." American Medical Collection Agency, a billing collections service provider, has informed Quest Diagnostics that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA's system containing personal information AMCA received from various entities, including from Quest. On May 31, 2019, AMCA notified Quest and Optum360 that the data on AMCA's affected system included information regarding approximately 11.9 million Quest patients. Since learning of the AMCA data security incident, we have suspended sending collection requests to AMCA. Quest will be working with Optum360 to ensure that Quest patients are appropriately notified consistent with the law.
