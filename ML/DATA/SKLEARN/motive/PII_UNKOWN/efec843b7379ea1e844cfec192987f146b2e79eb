The data was taken from FastBooking, a Paris-based company that sells hotel booking software to more than 4,000 hotels in 100 countries -as it claims on its website. In emails the company sent out to affected hotels today, FastBooking revealed the breach took place on June 14, when an attacker used a vulnerability in an application hosted on its server to install a malicious tool. According to FastBooking, the intruder stole information such as a hotel guests' first and last names, nationality, postal addresses, email addresses, and hotel booking-related information. The French company has sent emails to each affected hotel with details about the number of affected guests for each entity, and what type of data the attacker stole. Bleeping Computer has learned that FastBooking is also providing templates that each hotel can use to notify former guests of the breach, and templates to notify national data protection agencies about the leak of private guest data and their respective payment card details. The first hotel chain to inform customers of the FastBooking breach is Prince Hotels & Resorts in Japan. The hotel chain said the incident affected 124,963 guests who stayed at 82 of its hotels.
