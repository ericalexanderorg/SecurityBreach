Some Florida residents who have made unemployment claims may have had personal data stolen, officials said Thursday. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity has notified 98 people who were part of a data breach associated with unemployment claims, agency spokeswoman Paige Landrum said in an email. Officials didn't say when the breach occurred, how many people were affected or what information was taken. The breach was addressed within one hour of officials learning of it, Landrum said. The DEO has received more than 2 million claims seeking unemployment benefits from Floridians since the coronavirus pandemic caused mass business closings around the state, though only 1.6 million claims have been verified. State Sen. Linda Stewart, D-Orlando, expressed concern about the breach Thursday in a letter to Department of Management Services Secretary Jonathan Satter. Satter's department oversees information technology for other state agencies.
