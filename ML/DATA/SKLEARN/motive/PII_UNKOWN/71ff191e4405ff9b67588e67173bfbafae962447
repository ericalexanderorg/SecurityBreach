May 10, 2018 An SEC filing made this week outlines the total extent of what was lost in the breach. Suffice it to say at this point everyone is sick and tired of talking about the Equifax data breach. We now know the full extent of the data that was stolen from Equifax during the breach it originally reported on September 7, 2017. Equifax has now had an opportunity to perform a complete autopsy on the data breach, and while some of the information provided feels a little more like PR/Marketing than actionable intelligence, we do now have an idea as to the extent of the breach and what, beyond vague catch-alls like "Identities," was stolen. The attackers stole consumer records from a number of database tables with different schemas, and the data elements stolen were not consistently labeled. Not every database table contained a field for driver's license number, and for more common elements like first name, one table may have labeled the column containing first name as "FIRSTNAME," another may have used "USER FIRST NAME," and a third may have used "FIRST NM." With assistance from Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm, forensic investigators were able to standardize certain data elements for further analysis to determine the impacted consumers and Equifax's notification obligations. That's what makes the Equifax data breach so substantial, the information stolen can be used to create personas and commit legitimate acts of fraud.
