TaskRabbit has a job for cybersecurity experts: find out what happened to their own network. The handyman-for-hire app, which connects workers with people who have a task they'd rather pay someone else to do, sent an alert to its users on Monday, informing them that they were "Investigating a cybersecurity incident." While TaskRabbit is conducting its investigation, the app and the website will temporarily be taken down, the email said. TaskRabbit did not specify how many people were affected by the incident, or what information was lost. "We regret any inconvenience this may cause our clients and Taskers, and will reschedule any uncompleted tasks as soon as possible. For any Tasker who had a task scheduled today and is unable to complete the task, we will compensate them appropriately," a TaskRabbit representative said in an emailed statement. On Twitter, TaskRabbit users have sent complaints to the company, pointing out that TaskRabbit's website redirected them to a WordPress page showing the app's Github account. TaskRabbit responded to users on Twitter, writing that it's "Aware of the technical issue and are on the case!".
