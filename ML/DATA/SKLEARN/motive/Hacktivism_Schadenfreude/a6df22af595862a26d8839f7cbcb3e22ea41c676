A week after its website was defaced and then taken offline, ticket-selling service Ticketfly confirmed today that its customer database had indeed been hacked, with details of 27 million accounts purloined. The stolen information includes the names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses of registered Ticketfly users, including both ticket buyers and ticket sellers - the numerous nightclubs and other venues who are Ticketfly's primary clients. Credit-card details were not stolen, the statement posted on the Ticketfly site said, and neither were passwords of registered ticket buyers, but there was a possibility that encrypted passwords of Ticketfly clients might have been. On the night of May 30, an unknown person or persons calling themselves "IsHaKdZ" hijacked the Ticketfly website, replacing its front page with an image from "V for Vendetta" and declaring "Your Security Down im Not Sorry." Ticketfly quickly took down the site, stating on Twitter that there had been a "Cyber incident," and didn't bring it back online until June 2. Someone contacted Vice Motherboard on May 31 and claimed to be the Ticketfly hacker, adding that the site's entire customer database had been stolen. The hackers also said they had tried to extort Ticketfly for one bitcoin before releasing the data.
