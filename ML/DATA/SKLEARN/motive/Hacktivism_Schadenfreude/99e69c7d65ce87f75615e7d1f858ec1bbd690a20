A hacking group claims to have breached India's CNN-News18 news site to use it to refute claims that they hacked PayTM Mall earlier this week, BleepingComputer has learned. News18 is an English-language news channel that provides Indian and local news via the Indian Broadcasting Network and international news in a partnership with CNN. A hacker group that goes by the names "John Wick" and "Korean Hackers" have provided BleepingComputer with information on the hacking of the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter account and the online systems of popular Indian news channel, News18. In their quest to refute claims that they were behind PayTM hacks, "John Wick" breached Indian PM's Twitter account and allegedly hacked the TV channel News18 to spread the message on their innocence. In a paradoxical series of events, determined to assert their innocence regarding the PayTM Mall attack, "John Wick" hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Modi, telling the world they weren't the ones behind PayTM hacks. "There is no other intention to hack this account. Recently fake news of our name saying PayTM mall [was] hacked by us. So we have sent email to all news publishers in India [that] it's not us, no one replied, so we decided to post something," read one of the tweets published from the PM's verified Twitter account. These images demonstrate the hackers may have hacked the Indian news channel, News18's systems and sent out push notifications to its subscribers to deny their involvement in PayTM hacks. Identical to the ZEE5 hack where John Wick had allegedly taken control of the company's codebase, the hacker group provided screenshots showing code commit history for News18's codebase in a similar fashion.
