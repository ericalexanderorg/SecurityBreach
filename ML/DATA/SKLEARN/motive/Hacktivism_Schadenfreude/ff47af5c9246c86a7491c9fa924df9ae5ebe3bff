As ElasticSearch based leaks become the latest source of massive data exposures, Sky Brasil, one of the biggest subscription television services in Brazil, is the latest to leave its customers exposed after not securing the server with a password. Independent researcher Fabio Castro found the firm exposed the data of 32 million subscribers in 28.7GB of log files and a 429.1GB of API data that revealed names, home addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, client IP address, payment methods, and encrypted passwords. "The data the server stored was Full name, e-mail, password, pay-TV package data, client ip addresses, personal addresses, payment methods," Castro told BleepingComputer. NuData Security Vice President Ryan Wilk said the year has been a particularly bad year for news of the "Non-breach 'breach'" of sensitive user PII data. "The unfortunate mishandling of trusted data by Sky Brasil, and before that Deep Root, data.gov.uk, and WWE continues to show that sophisticated hacking is not required to obtain troves of identity data that can be used to create fraudulent identities or access online personas," Wilk said. "Understanding the user behind the device is key in effect devaluing the stolen identity data to any other person or entity," Wilk added. Earlier this week and ElasticSearch server exposed the data of nearly 57M U.S. residents and in another incident London-based Urban Massage app leaks data on 300K customers, including sexual misconduct claims.
