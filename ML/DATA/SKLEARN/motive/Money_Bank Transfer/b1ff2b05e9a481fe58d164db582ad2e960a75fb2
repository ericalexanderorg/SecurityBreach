Check Point became involved in the incident when a $1 million wire-transfer made between the two parties never reached the startup, researchers said in a report posted online Thursday. "The first domain was essentially the same as the Israeli startup domain, but with an additional 's' added to the end of the domain name," researchers wrote. "This infrastructure gave the attacker the ability to conduct the ultimate man-in-the-middle attack," researchers wrote. The attackers sent 18 emails to the VC firm and 14 to the startup in the course of the campaign to disrupt the transaction and modify bank details so the wire eventually was sent to an account that attackers could access. Attackers even managed to use this communication to cancel a meeting that was scheduled in Shanghai between the Chinese owner of the account where the transfer was headed and the CEO of the Israeli startup, researchers said. Even after the parties affected by the attack remediated it, the CFO of the Israeli startup continues to receive one email every month from the spoofed CEO account that asks him to perform a wire transaction, researchers added. The attack is a cautionary tale to anyone using wire transfers to send significant sums of money to put safeguards in place before the transaction goes through to ensure it can't be intercepted by a third party, and then to have incident response in place after to handle any crisis scenario immediately, researchers said.
