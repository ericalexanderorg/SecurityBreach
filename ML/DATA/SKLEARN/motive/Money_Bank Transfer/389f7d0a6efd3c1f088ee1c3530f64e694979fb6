A Texas school district, based outside of Austin, Tex., has lost $2.3 million after falling victim to an email scam. The Manor Independent School District encompasses 8,000 students from elementary to high school. January 10, 2020 - Manor, TX - The Manor Police Department along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating an incident involving a phishing email scam that resulted in the loss of approximately $2.3 million to the Manor Independent School District. "Identity-based scams often slip through legacy controls because those controls were designed to detect and prevent technically sophisticated attacks rather than socially-engineered threats, which are now the attack-type-of-choice for many email scammers." Business email compromise scams and other similar types of fraud efforts are squeezing more money than ever out of victims, with losses from the attacks almost doubling year-over-year in 2018 to reach $1.2 billion. In November, media conglomerate Nikkei Inc. fell victim to a BEC scam that fleeced the company out of $29 million. Other victims of scams include the City of Ocala in Florida, which was swindled out of $742,000, and a church in Brunswick, Ohio that was scammed out of $1.75 million in August.
