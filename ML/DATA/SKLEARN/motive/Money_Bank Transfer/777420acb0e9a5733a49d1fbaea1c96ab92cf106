The NCA arrested two males on January 22, 2020, in the West Hampstead and Ladbroke Grove areas of London, the authorities also interviewed a third person. On January 30, the NCA officers, along with officers from the PSNI, executed two warrants in the north and west Belfast areas and arrested a man on suspicion of money laundering offences, fraud, and theft. The police arrested another man, aged 33, at Heathrow Airport where he returned to the UK from China. "Our 12-month investigation, carried out with the help of the Malta Police Force Economic Crime Unit, has focused on a number of individuals we suspect may have been involved in laundering money on behalf of the organized crime group who carried out the cyber-attack," NCA Belfast branch commander David Cunningham said.
