Security researchers have discovered a cryptojacking worm that propagates using containers in the Docker Engine and has spread to more than 2,000 vulnerable Docker hosts. "The attacker compromised an unsecured Docker daemon, ran the malicious Docker container pulled from Docker Hub, downloaded a few scripts and a list of vulnerable hosts from C2 and repeatedly picked the next target to spread the worm," Palo Alto Networks's Unit 42 researchers explained. "If my host is compromised, the malicious container does not start immediately. Instead, I have to wait until another compromised host picks me and starts my mining process. Other compromised hosts can also randomly stop my mining process. Essentially, the miner on every infected host is randomly controlled by all other infected hosts." Sending the number of available CPUs on the compromised host to the C2. Downloading a file that contains a list of 2000+ IPs, randomly picking one as the next target and pulling and deploying a malicious Docker image that contains a docker client tool that is used to communicate with other Docker hosts remotely. Picking one of the compromised hosts from the list and pulling and deploying a Docker image that contains a cryptojacking binary on the host. The two malicious Docker images have been downloaded more than 16,500 times, but have since been removed from Docker Hub, along with another cryptojacking image by the same user. "While this cryptojacking worm doesn't involve sophisticated tactics, techniques, or procedures, the worm can periodically pull new scripts from the C2s, so it can easily repurpose itself to ransomware or any malware to fully compromise the hosts down the line and shouldn't be ignored. If a more potent worm is ever created to take a similar infiltration approach, it could cause much greater damage, so it's imperative for organizations to safeguard their Docker hosts," they noted.
