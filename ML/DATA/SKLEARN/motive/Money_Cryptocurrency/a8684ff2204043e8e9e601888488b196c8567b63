Phase One of the company's internal technical investigation is complete and a data security incident action plan is underway. The criminal investigation continues and Texthelp is working with the National Crime Agency and The National Cyber Security Centre to pursue the investigation further. Martin McKay, CTO and Data Security Officer said, "In light of other recent cyber attacks all over the world, we have been preparing for such an incident for the last year. Our data security action plan was actioned straight away and was effective, the risk was mitigated for all customers within a period of four hours." "Texthelp has in place continuous automated security tests for Browsealoud - these tests detected the modified file and as a result the product was taken offline. This removed Browsealoud from all our customer sites immediately, addressing the security risk without our customers having to take any action." Texthelp can report that this attacker did not attempt to extort or ransom money from Texthelp or Texthelp customers. The security breach has already been addressed, however Browsealoud will remain offline until Thursday 15th February at 12:00 GMT. This is to allow time for Texthelp customers to learn about the issue and the company's response plan. "Phase One of our internal investigation is complete and our customers have been notified. We are continuing to work with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Agency. An additional review will now be conducted by an independent security consultancy. The security of our products continues to be of the utmost priority for us, we are taking this very seriously and in light of this attack, we are strengthening our security systems further," confirmed Martin McKay.
