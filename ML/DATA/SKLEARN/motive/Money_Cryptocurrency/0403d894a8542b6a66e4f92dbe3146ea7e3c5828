In the latest incident, the U.S. authorities on Thursday arrested two more alleged cybercriminals from Massachusetts, charging them with stealing $550,000 in cryptocurrency from at least 10 victims using SIM swapping between November 2015 and May 2018. SIM Swapping, or SIM hijacking, is a technique that typically involves the social engineering of a target's mobile phone provider. An attacker makes a phony call posing as their targets and convinces the mobile phone provider to port the target's phone number to a SIM card belonging to the attacker. Hackers Also Targeted Executives of Cryptocurrency Companies According to the indictment, the two defendants - Eric Meiggs and Declan Harrington - not just only targeted users with high-value cryptocurrency accounts, but also targeted executives of cryptocurrency companies in an attempt to make a significant profit. The two defendants have also been charged for taking over social media accounts of their victims, including two who "Had high value or 'O.G.' social media account names."
