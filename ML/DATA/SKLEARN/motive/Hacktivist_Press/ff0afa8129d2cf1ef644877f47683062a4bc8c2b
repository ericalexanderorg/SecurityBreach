The database of Amber Windows contained 234.6 million records, including the personal information of over 500,000 UK individuals. TurgenSec attempted to responsibly disclose the data breach to Amber Windows. If the breach is the result of negligence or a serious security flaw then the company may be held responsible for the breach. In light of the recent breach of over 500,000 UK individuals' personal information, the ICO has been informed and will be investigating the breach. UK regulators have a duty to investigate breaches of sensitive personal information that has been stored or transferred abroad, particularly if the ICO is aware that encryption technologies are available, or could have been used, to secure the information. If the ICO finds Amber Windows Ltd. responsible for the breach, there will be large monetary repercussions for Amber Windows Ltd. and more questions raised about the protection of sensitive personal information. The threat to UK citizens with this breach is significant, which is why the ICO is investigating and why Amber Windows Ltd. will be held liable for failing to protect personal information of 500,000 UK citizens.
