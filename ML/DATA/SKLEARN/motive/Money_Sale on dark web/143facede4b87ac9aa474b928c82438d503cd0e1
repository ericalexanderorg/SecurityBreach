Responsible for the breach is a hacker going online as GnosticPlayers. Today, the hacker contacted ZDNet about his latest hack, involving Australian tech unicorn Canva, which he said he breached just hours before, earlier this morning. Of the total 139 million users, 78 million users had a Gmail address associated with their Canva account. ZDNet requested a sample of the hacked data, so we could verify the hacker's claims. "Canva was today made aware of a security breach which enabled access to a number of usernames and email addresses," a Canva spokesperson told ZDNet via email. Canva is one of Australia's biggest tech companies. Founded in 2012, the Canva website has become a favorite among regular users and large companies who often use it to build quick websites, design logos, or put together eye-catching marketing materials.
