An exposed database was discovered leaking the personal information of 26,000 North American Honda owners and their vehicles. The Elasticsearch database in question is owned by the American Honda Motor Co., a North American subsidiary of the Honda Motor Co. The cloud misconfiguration exposed the full names, email addresses, mailing addresses and phone numbers of vehicle owners, as well as vehicle makes and models, VIN numbers, agreement IDs and other service information. While Diachenko estimated that there were 976 million total records in the database, Honda in a statement to the researcher said that there were roughly 26,000 unique consumer related records. "We quickly investigated this issue, determined the specific breach in protocol, and took immediate steps to address the vulnerability," Honda said in a statement. It's only the latest security faux pas to hit Honda. In 2018, a Honda affiliate in India left two Amazon S3 buckets misconfigured for more than a year, affecting 50,000 users of the Honda Connect App, which is used to manage automobile service and maintenance. "Honda is continuing to perform due diligence, and if it is determined that data was compromised, we will take appropriate actions in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. We will continue to work on proactive security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future," Honda said in its statement.
