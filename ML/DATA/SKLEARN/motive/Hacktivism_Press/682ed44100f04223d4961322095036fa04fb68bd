Over 752,000 birth certificate applications have been exposed online by an unnamed company that enables people to obtain copies of their birth and death records from state governments in the United States, TechCrunch reports. The applications were found on the Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform, sitting out in the open with no password protection whatsoever. Although the application process varies from state to state, the ultimate goal is the same - to allow people to acquire a copy of their records. On top of that, the applications also include the names of family members, historical information such as past addresses, or the reason behind applying for the documents. The affected cache included applications dating all the way back to 2017. The authenticity of the data was verified by TechCrunch by comparing them against public records. Data leaks from misconfigured public-facing file repositories may result in identity theft and fraud.
