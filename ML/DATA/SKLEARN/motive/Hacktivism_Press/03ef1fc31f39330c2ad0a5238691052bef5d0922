India's largest bank, the State Bank of India, has leaked the financial data of millions of its customers, according to a TechCrunch report. The bank, according to TechCrunch on Wednesday, left a server with the banking data of its customers unprotected. The reported server made sensitive data accessible for anyone to view, but the issue appears to have been fixed. The unprotected server was discovered at one of its data centres in Mumbai by a security researcher, who preferred to remain anonymous. The server, which stored two months of financial data from SBI Quick, is a text message and call-based system that allows customers to review their recent transactions, balances, and credit information. Just days earlier, SBI had accused Aadhaar's authority, Unique Identification Authority of India, of mishandling citizen data that allowed fake Aadhaar identity cards to be created. "Speaking about this particular leak, I think virtually any large financial organisations may face a similar incident. Modern IT infrastructures are so complicated that virtually no single company has an up2date and holistic inventory of their digital assets, let alone continuous monitoring and related security processes. While data sharing with trusted third-parties makes privacy and data protection virtually impossible."
