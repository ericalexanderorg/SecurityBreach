According to WizCase, online forex trading site FBS left nearly 20 TB of data exposed on an unsecured ElasticSearch server containing over 16 billion records. According to WizCase web security expert Chase Williams the data contained millions of confidential records, including names, passwords, email addresses, passport numbers, national IDs, credit cards, financial transactions, and more. The team discovered the leak on October 1 and contacted FBS the next day. It's unknown how long FBS left the server unprotected before that. "Despite containing very sensitive financial data, the server was left open without any password protection or encryption. The WizCase team found that the FBS information was accessible to anyone. The breach is a danger to both FBS and its customers. User information on online trading platforms should be well secured to prevent similar data leaks," said Williams. Threat actors can also use the leaked information to launch scams, phishing, and malware attacks against FBS users. "The data could be the basis for establishing trust to encourage clicks, malware downloads, and the availing of more confidential information. Armed with the sensitive authentic data, a cybercriminal will sound more credible when they request for information over the phone or email," Williams said.
