The server wasn't protected with a password, allowing anyone who knew where to look to peek in and snoop on a near-real-time stream of text messages. Worse, the database - running on Amazon's Elasticsearch - was configured with a Kibana front-end, making the data within easily readable, browsable and searchable for names, cell numbers and the contents of the text messages themselves. It's firms like Voxox that act as a gateway and converting those codes into text messages, to be passed on to the cell networks for delivery to the user's phone. At the time of its closure, the database appeared to have a little over 26 million text messages year-to-date. Many messages included two-factor verification codes for Google accounts in Latin America;. We also found messages that contained Microsoft's account password reset codes and Huawei ID verification codes;. With access to the text message through the exposed database, hijacking an account could take seconds.
