Federal prosecutors on Tuesday unsealed charges that accused two Chinese government intelligence officers and eight alleged co-conspirators of conducting sustained computer intrusions into 13 companies in an attempt to steal designs for a turbofan engine used in commercial jetliners. Their primary goal was stealing data that would allow a Chinese government-owned company to design its own jetliner. With the exception of Capstone Turbines, a Los Angeles-based gas turbine maker, other targeted companies weren't identified by name and were referred to only as companies A through L. "Members of the conspiracy targeted, among other things, data and information related to a turbofan engine used in commercial jetliners," prosecutors wrote in the superseding indictment. The turbofan engine targeted by members of the conspiracy was being developed through a partnership between Company I and an aerospace company based in the US. As described herein, members of the conspiracy hacked Company I and other companies that manufactured parts for the turbofan engine, including Companies A, F, and G, to steal sensitive data from these companies that could be used by Chinese entities to build the same or similar engine without incurring substantial research and development expenses. According to the indictment, they registered "Doppelganger" domain names such as capstonetrubine.com that closely resembled the legitimate domain names of aerospace companies. In early December 2013, prosecutors said, members of the conspiracy used the same tactic to hack the Australian registrar again, this time to hijack domain names of one of the targeted technology companies. The indictment is the third time since September that federal prosecutors have named Chinese intelligence officers as defendants in criminal hacks against US companies.
