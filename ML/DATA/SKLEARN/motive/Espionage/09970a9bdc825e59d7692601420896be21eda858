Recently, ESET researchers also discovered a campaign of the Winnti Group targeting several Hong Kong universities with ShadowPad and Winnti malware. Some of the C&C domains used by PipeMon were used by Winnti malware in previous campaigns mentioned in our white paper on the Winnti Group arsenal. The certificate used to sign the PipeMon installer, modules and additional tools is linked to a video game company that was compromised in a supply-chain attack in late 2018 by the Winnti Group and was likely stolen at that time. PipeMon modules and installers are all signed with the same valid code-signing certificate that was likely stolen during a previous campaign of the Winnti Group. A custom AceHash build signed with a Wemade IO stolen certificate already mentioned in our previous white paper and usually used by the Winnti Group was found on some machines compromised with PipeMon. Once again, the Winnti Group has targeted video game developers in Asia with a new modular backdoor signed with a code-signing certificate likely stolen during a previous campaign and sharing some similarities with the PortReuse backdoor. This new implant shows that the Winnti Group is still actively developing new tools using multiple open source projects; they don't rely solely on their flagship backdoors, ShadowPad and the Winnti malware.
