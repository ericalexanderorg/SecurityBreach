ThyssenKrupp, one of the world's largest multinationals and one of the leading steel producers, said today in a statement that it was the victim of an economical espionage campaign carried out by hackers based in Southeast Asia. The company said the hackers' goals were to breach its network and steal technological know-how and research from its industrial research branches. A ThyssenKrupp spokesperson told German media that they detected the intrusion in April, and tracked it down to February this year. The ThyssenKrupp CERT investigators didn't shut out the hackers once the cyber-attack was discovered but kept them under surveillance while they slowly "Revised" all the breached IT systems. ThyssenKrupp says the hackers were only interested in stealing technical trade secrets, and that they didn't try to sabotage any of its industrial systems, such as its steel mills located or marine shipyards where the company builds submarines and warships. "The incident is not attributable to security deficiencies at ThyssenKrupp," the company also added, describing the attack and the hackers as "Professional professional." An attorney for U.S. Steel said the hackers stole decades of research needed to create next generation of high-strength steel, which Chinese manufacturers started mass-producing after the hack.
