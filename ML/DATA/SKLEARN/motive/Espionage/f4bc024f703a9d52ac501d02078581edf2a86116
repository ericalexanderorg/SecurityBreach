From at least January to April 2020, suspected Vietnamese actors APT32 carried out intrusion campaigns against Chinese targets that Mandiant Threat Intelligence believes was designed to collect intelligence on the COVID-19 crisis. Spear phishing messages were sent by the actor to China's Ministry of Emergency Management as well as the government of Wuhan province, where COVID-19 was first identified. While targeting of East Asia is consistent with the activity we've previously reported on APT32, this incident, and other publicly reported intrusions, are part of a global increase in cyber espionage related to the crisis, carried out by states desperately seeking solutions and nonpublic information. The first known instance of this campaign was on Jan. 6, 2020, when APT32 sent an email with an embedded tracking link to China's Ministry of Emergency Management using the sender address [.]com and the subject . The embedded link contained the victim's email address and code to report back to the actors if the email was opened. Mandiant Threat Intelligence uncovered additional tracking URLs that revealed targets in China's Wuhan government and an email account also associated with the Ministry of Emergency Management. APT32 likely used COVID-19-themed malicious attachments against Chinese speaking targets.
