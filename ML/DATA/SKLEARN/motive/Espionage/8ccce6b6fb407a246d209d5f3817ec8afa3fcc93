Top oil producers prepared for a weeklong meeting earlier this month to plan a response to slumping prices of crude, espionage hackers commenced a sophisticated spear-phishing campaign that was concentrated on US-based energy companies. A barrage of emails that started on March 31 purported to come from Engineering for Petroleum and Process Industries, a real Egyptian state oil company. The email, which was sent to about 150 oil and gas companies over a week starting on March 31, attached two files that masqueraded as bidding conditions, forms, and a request for proposal. "To someone in the oil & gas industry, who has knowledge about these projects, the email and the information within might seem sufficiently convincing to open the attachments," researchers from security firm Bitdefender wrote in a post published on Tuesday. The email was sent to 18 companies, 15 of which were shipment companies in the Philippines. "This email serves as another example of the length to which attackers will go to get their facts straight, make the email seem legitimate, and specifically target a vertical." The campaign provides a reminder that, despite the growing awareness of phishing attacks, they remain one of the most effective ways for attackers to gain a foothold in targeted companies.
