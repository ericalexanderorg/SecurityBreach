In the notorious 2016 breach of the Democratic National Committee, the group of Russian hackers known as Fancy Bear stole the show, leaking the emails and documents they had obtained in a brazen campaign to sway the results of the US presidential election. Researchers at the Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET today released new findings that reveal a years-long espionage campaign by a group of Kremlin-sponsored hackers that ESET refers to as the Dukes. They're also known known by the names Cozy Bear and APT29, and have been linked to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR. ESET found that the Dukes had penetrated the networks of at least three targets: The ministries of foreign affairs at two Eastern European countries and one European Union nation, including the network of that EU country's Washington, DC embassy. The researchers found that the spying campaign extend both years before the DNC hack and years after-until as recently as June of this year-and used an entirely new collection of malware tools, some of which deployed novel tricks to avoid detection. "They rebuilt their arsenal," says ESET researcher Matthieu Faou, who presented the new findings earlier this week at ESET's research conference in Bratislava. The Dukes' new tools use clever tricks to hide themselves and their communications inside a victim's network. The new tools also include lighter-weight implant malware ESET has named PolyglotDuke and RegDuke, each of which serves as a first-stage program capable of installing other software on a target system.
