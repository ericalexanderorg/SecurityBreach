The Winnti malware family was first reported in 2013 by Kaspersky Lab¹. Threat actors leveraging Winnti malware have victimized a diverse set of targets for varied motivations. While the name 'Winnti' in public reporting was previously used to signify a single actor, pronounced divergence in targeting and tradecraft between campaigns has led industry consensus to break up the tracking of the continued use of the Winnti malware under different actor clusters. The Linux version of Winnti is comprised of two files: a main backdoor and a library used to hide it's activity on an infected system. The library used to hide Winnti's system activity is a copy of the open-source userland rootkit Azazel¹⁰, with minor changes. Winnti malware handles outbound communications using multiple protocols including: ICMP, HTTP, as well as custom TCP and UDP protocols. While the outbound communication mechanisms are well documented, less attention has been paid to a feature of recent versions of Winnti we came across in the Linux variant that allows the operators to initiate a connection directly to an infected host, without requiring a connection to a control server.
