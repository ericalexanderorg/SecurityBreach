Malaysia's MyCERT issued a security alert to warn of a hacking campaign targeting government officials that was carried out by the China-linked APT40 group. Malaysia's Computer Emergency Response Team warns of a cyber espionage campaign carried out by the China-linked APT40 group aimed at Malaysian government officials. "MyCERT observed an increase in number of artifacts and victims involving a campaign against Malaysian Government officials by a specific threat group." reads the alert issued by MyCERT. "The group motives is believe to be data theft and exfiltration." The advisory doesn't explicitly attribute the campaign to the Chinese APT, but references included in the alert point to the APT40 hacking group. The cyber-espionage group tracked as APT40, apparently linked to the Chinese government, is focused on targeting countries important to the country's Belt and Road Initiative. The APT40 group has been active since at least 2013 and appears to be focused on supporting naval modernization efforts of the Government of Beijing. Intrusion Truth did not associate the group from Hainan with a specific Chinese APT group, but FireEye and Kaspersky researchers believe that the China-linked group is the APT40.
