Seven state insurance commissioners, in a new report on their investigation into the massive cyberattack against health insurer Anthem Inc. in February 2015, offer a detailed account of what happened in the incident, which began with a phishing campaign. The investigation by the insurance commissioners' examination team - and a separate internal investigation by security firm Mandiant, which Anthem hired - determined the data breach began on Feb. 18, 2014, when a user within one of Anthem's subsidiaries opened a phishing email containing malicious content. The investigation team found that Anthem had taken reasonable measures before the data breach to protect its data and employed a remediation plan resulting in a rapid and effective response to the breach once it was discovered. The team worked with Anthem to develop a plan to address its security vulnerabilities and conducted a penetration test exercise to validate the strength of Anthem's corrective measures. In terms of the money Anthem has been spending in bolstering security in the wake of the breach, "Anthem is making a large but proportionate investment," Berger says. The report also points out that the examination team noted "Exploitable vulnerabilities in the immediate aftermath of the data breach, and that Anthem had developed a remediation plan to address those issues. It is the examination team's view that Anthem's improvements to its cybersecurity protocols and schedule of planned future improvements appeared to be reasonable efforts to secure the environment beyond the initial data breach remediation tasks." "The Anthem breach and investigation afterward demonstrate how important it is for organizations to clean up and tighten the access control measures and the value of two factor authentication," he notes.
