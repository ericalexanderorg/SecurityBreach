Memo 25/07/2019 - TLP:WHITE Extended use of the likely Chinese Winnti malware Reference: Memo [190725-1] - Version: 1.0 Keywords: China, Germany, cyber-espionage, cybercrime, industry, political Sources: publicly available information Key Points   According to media, the Winnti malware has been used for cyber espionage purposes against German industries. Summary On July 23, German public broadcasters BR and NDR reported1 that the likely Chinese Winnti malware has infected at least six DAX2 corporations. Initially, the collective behind Winnti was motivated by financial gain and the gaming sector was especially targeted. The Winnti hackers were able to directly access Gameforge's databases and modify accounts to become 'virtually' richer. The Winnti malware has also reportedly infected political targets. According to BR findings, victims of Winnti malware include the following: Sector Gaming Software Technology Pharma Chemical Government Government Hotels Airline Targets Gameforge, Valve Teamviewer Siemens, Sumitomo, Thyssenkrupp Bayer, Roche BASF, Covestro, Shin-Etsu Hong Kong Possibly the 'Central Tibetan Administration' via a telecom provider Marriott Lion Air Likely motive Financial gain Industrial espionage Political espionage Personal data collection Comments The case of Winnti is an excellent illustration of a malware initially developed for cybercriminal purposes and which has since been repurposed for cyber-espionage. In an attempt to distinguish cybercriminal and cyber-espionage activities, industry reporting has given several different names to group(s) using Winnti such as Winnti group, Wicked Spider, Wicked Panda, APT17, APT22, Barium, Axiom, Deputy Dog, Dogfish, ShadowHammer, and Blackfly.
