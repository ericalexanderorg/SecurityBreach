The company in question is U.S.-based Westat, a professional services company that provides research services to U.S. state and local governments, as well as more than 80 federal agencies. Researchers at Intezer uncovered the campaign after detecting a malicious file in January, purporting to be an employee satisfaction survey for Westat employees and customers. "The technical analysis of the new malware variants reveals this Iranian government-backed group has invested substantial efforts into upgrading its toolset in an attempt to evade future detection." The downloaded executable file is actually a new version of the TONEDEAF malware, a backdoor commonly used by APT34 as a custom tool. TONEDEAF 2.0, as researchers call it, serves the same purpose as the original malware, with the same general flow and functionality. "In contrast to the original TONEDEAF, TONEDEAF 2.0 contains solely arbitrary shell execution capabilities, and doesn't support any predefined commands. It's also more stealthy and contains new tricks such as dynamic importing, string decoding and a victim deception method," researchers said. The ongoing attack comes on the heels of conflict between the U.S. and Iran, which saw a peak after U.S. drones on Jan. 3 killed Qassem Soleimani, an Iranian general with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who was highly-esteemed in Iran.
