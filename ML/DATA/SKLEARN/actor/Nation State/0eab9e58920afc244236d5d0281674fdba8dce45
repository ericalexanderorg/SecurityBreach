Security experts who analyzed the attack determined its behavior was consistent with a form of ransomware called Petya. To help us in our effort, below is a timeline of how the attack unfolded. Threat intelligence provider Symantec Security Response confirms that Petya ransomware is responsible for the digital attacks. Attackers capitalized on this exposure by incorporating the exploit into a new variant of WannaCry ransomware. Kaspersky Lab tweets out a statement clarifying that the ransomworm is not a variant of Petya but is actually a new ransomware they named "NotPetya." They also reveal the threat has affected approximately 2,000 organizations at the time of their posting. Victims keep sending money to Petya, but will not get their files back: No way to contact the attackers, as their email address was killed. With the NotPetya attackers' email blocked, victims have no way of recovering their files if they didn't have data backups already in place.
