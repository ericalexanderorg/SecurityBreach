A cyber-espionage group tracked as Bronze President has been targeting countries in South and East Asia, Secureworks experts warn. Researchers at Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit have uncovered a cyber espionage campaign carried out by an APT group tracked as Bronze President, The Bronze President group is targeting political and law enforcement organizations and NGOs in Asia. "BRONZE PRESIDENT is a likely People's Republic of China-based targeted cyberespionage group that uses both proprietary and publicly available tools to target NGO networks." reads the post published by Secureworks. BRONZE PRESIDENT's infrastructure is linked to entities within the PRC.There are several connections between a subset of the group's operational infrastructure and PRC-based Internet service providers. The group uses tools such as PlugX that have historically been leveraged by threat groups based in the PRC. "It is likely that Bronze President is sponsored or at least tolerated by the PRC government. The threat group's systemic long-term targeting of NGO and political networks does not align with patriotic or criminal threat groups," continues Secureworks. The TTPs of the group suggests that the group is a highly organized state-sponsored actor. "The concurrent use of so many tools during a single intrusion suggests that the group could include threat actors with distinct tactics, roles, and tool preferences."
