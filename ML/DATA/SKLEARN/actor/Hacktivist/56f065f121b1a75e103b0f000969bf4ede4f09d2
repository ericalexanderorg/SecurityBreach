The leak exposed sensitive personal data of users and hotel guests, along with a complete overview of their hotel and travel reservations. Our team viewed highly sensitive data exposing the personal details of government and military personnel, and their travel arrangements to locations around the world, both past and future. The extent of a data breach and the owner of the data are obvious, and the issue quickly resolved. Much of the data exposed originated from external travel and hospitality platforms using the database owner's platform to interact with one another. Any company concerned with the travel logistics of high-level military personnel should be adhering to the strictest data protection practices. Hackers can use the exposed data to create complex scams targeting the businesses affected, their guests, and the US government. Any external company dealing with government and military data should be following strict data security protocols and ensuring there are no vulnerabilities in the software they're using.
