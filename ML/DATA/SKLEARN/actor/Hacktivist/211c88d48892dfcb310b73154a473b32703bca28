The #FifthOfNovember has arrived, the Italian branch of Anonymous and LulzSecITA hacked websites of professional orders, prefecture of Naples, and also the telephone operator Lyca Mobile. The Million Mask March, also known as "Operation Vendetta" is a worldwide, annual protest associated with the hacktivist group Anonymous occurring annually on Guy Fawkes Day, the 5th of November. Italian hacktivists claim to have hacked the Chamber of Deputies, the prefecture of Naples, the order of the lawyers of Arezzo, Grosseto and Perugia, the Environment Agency in the Abruzzo and Puglia regions and many other sites. The popular group of Italian hacktivists LulzSecITA also joined the protest and hacked the Italian site of the telephone company Lyca Mobile. The group leaked public ID cards, passports, driving licenses, telephone records and credit cards of the telephone company Lyca Mobile. The content of one of the folders leaked by the hacktivists appears to belong to the email account of a company's official, lycamobile[at]lycamobile[. According to the experts the hackers may have had the complete control of the account, but fortunately, their intent was to demonstrate the hack of security instead of defrauding users.
