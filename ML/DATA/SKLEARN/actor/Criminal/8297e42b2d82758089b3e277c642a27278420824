Hackers used phishing emails to break into a Virginia bank in two separate cyber intrusions over an eight-month period, making off with more than $2.4 million total. The email allowed the intruders to install malware on the victim's PC and to compromise a second computer at the bank that had access to the STAR Network, a system run by financial industry giant First Data that the bank uses to handle debit card transactions for customers. Just eight months later - in January 2017 according to the lawsuit - hackers broke in to the bank's systems once more, again gaining access to the financial institution's systems via a phishing email. Prior to executing the second heist, the hackers used the bank's Navigator system to fraudulently credit more than $2 million to various National Bank accounts. Verizon also told the bank that the malware the attackers used to gain their initial foothold at the bank in the 2017 breach was embedded in a booby-trapped Microsoft Word document. "In its Coverage Determination, Everest further determined that the 2016 Intrusion and the 2017 Intrusion were a single event, and thus, pursuant to the Debit Card Rider, National Bank's total coverage under the Bond was $50,000.00 for both intrusions," the bank said in its lawsuit. On July 20 it filed a response to the bank's claims, alleging that National Bank has not accurately characterized the terms of its coverage or fully explained the basis for Everest's coverage decision.
