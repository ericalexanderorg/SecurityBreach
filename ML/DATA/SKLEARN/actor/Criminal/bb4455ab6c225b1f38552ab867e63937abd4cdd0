The online shop for the Atlanta Hawks professional NBA basketball team had malicious code injected into it that allowed attackers to steal customer's credit card information. This type of attack is called a MageCart infection and is when attackers compromise an ecommerce site to inject JavaScript into the checkout or cart pages. This script then steals credit card and address information entered into these pages and sends it off to a remote server for the attackers to collect. According to Sanguine Security, a MageCart script was detected on April 20th on the checkout page for the Atlanta Hawks' online shop as shown below. According to a tweet by Sanguine's Willem de Groot, a Hawke's spokesperson stated that the site was no longer affected by the script. The malware is no longer active on the site, the representative said. The best solution is to make sure you have control over any third-party scripts you are using on the site, your web platform is updated, and you monitor for new vulnerabilities found in plugins that you may be using.
