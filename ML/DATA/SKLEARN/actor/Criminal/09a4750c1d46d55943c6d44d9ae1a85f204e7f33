Mexico's state-owned oil company, Pemex, has suffered a DoppelPaymer ransomware attack that demanded $4.9 million USD in order to decrypt their files. On Sunday, November 10th, Pemex was hit with a ransomware attack that the company states affected less than 5% of their computers. In a later statement posted to Twitter, Pemex states that they are operating normally and that there was no affect on their fuel production, supply, and inventory. Pemex improves the security of its computer systems and encourages/recommends members of the oil community and the society to disregard rumors that hurt the image of the company. While reports initially stated that Pemex was affected by the Ryuk Ransomware, leaked ransom notes and the Tor payment site confirm that it was the DoppelPaymer infection, which is an offshoot of the BitPaymer ransomware. Though the ransom note does not indicate the name of the company, a source familiar with the matter shared the full Tor payment site URL with BleepingComputer, which identifies Pemex as the victim. Security researchers MalwareHunterTeam and Vitali Kremez were also able to find the malware sample used in the Pemex attack, which further confirms the DoppelPaymer infection.
