Hackers injected 15 lines of card skimming code on the online retailer's payments page which remained for more than a month between August 14 and September 18, Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at RiskIQ, told TechCrunch. The code siphoned off credit card data from unsuspecting customers to a server controlled by the hackers with a similar domain name - likely to avoid detection. In an email to customers, Newegg chief executive Danny Lee said the company has "Not yet determined which customer accounts may have been affected." When reached, a Newegg spokesperson did not immediately comment. Klijnsma called the incident "Another well-disguised attack" that looked near-identical to the recent British Airways credit card breach, and earlier, the Ticketmaster breach. Like that breach, RiskIQ attributed the Newegg credit card theft to the Magecart group, a collective of hackers that carry out targeted attacks against vulnerable websites. "The breach of Newegg shows the true extent of Magecart operators' reach," said Klijnsma. Anyone who entered their credit card data during the period should immediately contact their banks.
