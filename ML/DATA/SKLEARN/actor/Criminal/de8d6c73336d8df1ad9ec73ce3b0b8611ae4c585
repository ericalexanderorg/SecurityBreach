In a case of business email compromise, Chinese hackers stole $18.6 million from the Indian arm of Tecnimont SpA, an Italian engineering company, through an elaborate cyber fraud scheme that included impersonating the firm's chief executive, the Economic Times reports. The scammers sent emails requesting funds to the India head of Tecnimont, part of the publicly traded Maire Tecnimont, from an account that looked deceptively similar to one used by the Italian group's CEO, and also organized conference calls to discuss a "Confidential" acquisition in China, the ET report said. Defending against sophisticated BEC scams can be more difficult than spotting a phishing email, security experts note. According to the report in Economic Times, after sending emails to head of Indian subsidiary of the Milan-headquartered firm, hackers then arranged a series of conference calls to discuss a confidential acquisition in China. Tools such as DMARC, Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance, and SPF, Sender Policy Framework, only work when emails are sent from the same domain name. "DMARC is a lot about business email compromise, spoofing of email etc, but it works only if hackers are spoofing on your domain. In such cases, SPF policies and DMARC will work and stop you from getting conned," says Shomiron Das Gupta, founder and CEO at Netmonastery, a SIEM security and event log management firm. In BEC attacks, the fake message often comes from a legitimate email account that an attacker has gained access to, either through social engineering or a targeted compromise.
