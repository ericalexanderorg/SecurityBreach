## What is this?
This project is a catalog of security breaches. [This directory](https://github.com/ericalexanderorg/SecurityBreach/tree/master/DATA/BREACHES/V1) contains json files of breaches that have been cataloged. You can also view the data through [the UI](https://ericalexander.org/SecurityBreach)


## Why?
The project was started to keep up on the state of breaches. To help answer questions like `what are the patterns related to who's behind breaches?` and `how are breaches occuring?`

The project is open source and available on Github so anyone can use the data for improved situational awareness.
